        "title": "Josh Herrin crash hands fourth straight win for Bobby Fong in VIR Superbike Round 6, Race 2",
        "body": "With six rounds in the books and three on tap, the points battle took an abrupt turn at Virginia International Raceway in Alton, Virginia, when Josh Herrin crashed while leading on Lap 3 and opened the door for Bobby Fong to sweep the weekend and score his fourth consecutive win.\n\n\"Josh Herrin got by me,\" Fong said. \"I'm like, 'Okay. I could already see he was riding really hard for the first two laps.' He was already out of control. I'm like, 'I'm just going to sit here. He'll put his pace.' I didn't know how the race was going to go, but I knew once lap nine or 10 rolls around, I would be pretty good. He made a small mistake. Bummer for him. I'm stoked to get the win. Four in a row, which is nice. I got to stay humble and just calm. Hero to zero in this racing world happens very fast.\"\n\nHerrin learned that final lesson only too well, earning just 18 points during the weekend to Fong's 50.\n\nHerrin remounted and finished the race, but was three laps off the pace at the end. Fong's 25 points for winning the race allowed him to close to within five of the championship lead. Cameron Beaubier is 11 points further back in third, making this a three-race shootout with three rounds remaining.\n\nBut the weekend could just as easily have been a disaster for Fong, who developed electrical issues on the formation lap.\n\n\"When I got to the start/finish line, after the warmup lap, that whole warmup lap going to the start/finish line, my dash wasn't working,\" Fong said. \"It was staying all red and it was black. So, I was like, 'I think I need to restart this thing.' This thing needed a battery to start. So, I did the switch on and off and it died. Then I started back up and the dash was still there. So, I had to recycle the whole program. It's very rare that it could actually start without the battery. So, I finally got my stuff together and I pushed the button, and it started. The first lap, I was honestly just trying to get back in my rhythm. It kind of just threw me off.\"\n\nHeading into Mid-Ohio Raceway, Fong has an opportunity to match Herrin's early-season success and score a fifth consecutive victory.\n\nBobby Fong wins VIR Superbike Round 6, Race 1, Josh Herrin slips to third\n\nBobby Fong showed incredible speed during his third consecutive victory in Superbikes.\n\nWith Herrin out of the picture, Fong gapped the field by more than 14 seconds, but spectators were engaged by a four-race battle for the final two podium spots.\n\nOn Saturday, Sean Dylan Kelly raised the ire of Herrin for what the championship leader believed was rough riding. The pair were embroiled in a battle for the final podium position, which would have been the first of 2025 for Kelly. Denied the honor one day previous, he made certain to achieve it on Sunday with a second-place finish.\n\n\"It was insanely important (to finish on the podium),\" Kelly said. \"I think it's been coming since the first race weekend. If you look at Atlanta, I finished fourth, a few tenths from the podium. It took six race weekends, or I don't know how many we're at now, and a lot of close moments, a lot of good battles, a lot of good speed, but it just wasn't going. A lot of frustrating moments. Probably the most I've ever had in racing. I always managed to keep my head down and keep focused. Yesterday was extremely close, too. Finishing fourth again, a couple tenths off.\"\n\nKelly was focused forward, trying to match the Fong's pace, and was surprised by the pack that formed behind his Suzuki.\n\n\"With five laps to go, I didn't know the group was that big. I honestly thought it was Beaubier behind me. So, with five laps to go, I started hearing a bike much closer. So, I just started defending. Completely different lines everywhere. I heard a bike on my butt, bad. Then, when I go into the last corner, I go into turn 10, and I see this guy pass me. I'm like, what is Richie (Escalante) doing passing me? I didn't know it was going to be Richie. The first thing I thought was, 'I think we got a double podium for the team, which is amazing by itself.' But I also didn't want this guy to beat me, so I set up last corner really well. Definitely excited to finish in P2, finish on the podium with this guy.\"\n\nEscalante had the best ride of his Superbike career.\n\n\"I'm really happy, honestly,\" Escalante said. \"We started the weekend with a big problem with the bike. I didn't feel really good on the exit, especially it was spinning a lot. But I think everybody on the track was spinning a lot. But step by step, I feel better and better with the bike. Then finally this morning, I found something in the electronics with the rear grip. I think for sure it worked in the race. One of my best starts. I think in this category, in the Superbike class, it's really important.\n\n\"So then when I saw Herrin crash, the group is together again. So, I said, 'okay, maybe it's possible to battle for the podium.' Then I have a big, insane battle with (Cameron) Beaubier, (Jake) Gagne. All the time Sean is in the front. Then maybe with six laps to go, I know my race pace in the end always is good. So finally, I'm close to the front. In the end I feel really good with the bike. I made some passes in turn 10.\"\n\nBeaubier finished off the podium for only the third time this season, but as part of the five-rider battle for second, he can take some positives away from the track. Less than a second, 0.702 seconds to be exact, separated second from sixth.\n\nJake Gagne rounded out the top five with Hayden Gillim close behind in sixth.",

        "body": "Beijing is getting drenched by another round of heavy rain, one week after torrential downpours across parts of the Chinese capital unleashed flooding that claimed at least 44 lives.\n\nThe city's meteorological service elevated its rainstorm warning signal to red at 1 p.m. local time on Monday, the highest alert in a tri-colored system, up from orange earlier in the day. Some places could get more than 200 millimeters (7.9 inches) over six hours, raising the risk of landslides, the forecaster said.\n\nThe heaviest precipitation is expected to start at 6 p.m. and extend through dawn on Tuesday morning, according to the China Meteorological Administration. A collision of low pressure up in the atmosphere with another region of high pressure is triggering the heavy rain, the national weather agency said.\n\nRelated: China Warns of More Floods as Extreme Storms Hit World's No. 2 Economy\n\nThe deluge threatens another round of flash flooding, particularly in the hard-hit mountainous suburban areas due to saturated ground. Across the Beijing area, the soil is over-saturated up to a depth of 50 millimeters following rain last week, according to government data.\n\nAuthorities urged residents not to venture outside unless necessary, and schools suspended in-person classes, according to a city government statement.\n\nOther areas of China's north, including Hebei and Tianjin, are predicted to see heavy rainfall through Tuesday afternoon. The southern Chinese coast, affected by the southwest monsoon, is also getting a drenching.",

        "title": "Democrat Darling Jasmine Crockett: 'Donald Trump Is a Piece of Sh*t'",
        "body": "Democrat darling Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) went off on another rant and declared that President Trump is a \"piece of shit\" before proceeding to blame Republicans in Congress as well as the Supreme Court of the United States for being \"complicit.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump is a piece of shit, ok? We know that. Yes -- yes, he is. He is,\" Crockett said to cheers during a rant at a MoveOn event in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nHowever, Crockett said if this were a \"functioning\" democracy, Trump would not be able to get away with \"this,\" although it remains unclear what \"this\" is referring to.\n\n\"But he's been able to get away with this because the House Republicans are complicit. He's been able to get away with this because Senate Republicans are complicit, but most importantly, the courts, especially the Supreme Court, is complicit,\" Crockett said before declaring that they must put guardrails on the Supreme Court due to this alleged complicity.\n\n\"And so I think one of the places that we have to start is we are absolutely -- they are the, they are the highest court in the land, and they have no ethics guardrails,\" she said.\n\n\"Now you go down to the lower courts and they do, how much sense does that make when we know that they're taking money? We have the paper trail, and they refuse to put guardrails on themselves. So it's time for us to do it for them,\" she added.\n\nThis is far from the first time Crockett has made headlines for her tirades against Trump and Republicans. The Texas Democrat -- who has referred to Trump as a \"wannabe Hitler\" and has asserted that violence is coming from MAGA -- started shortly into Trump's second term, kicking off with a cringeworthy video urging Americans to ignore Trump's address to the nation back in early March.\n\nOther controversies involving Crockett include her mocking Christian lawmakers who want to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by asserting they are \"set on taking food from the hungry,\" accusing the GOP of pursuing a \"demonic\" agenda, informing the American public that she is unsure if there will be elections in four years, referring to paralyzed Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) as \"Governor Hot Wheels,\" and much more.",

        "body": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Dozens of Palestinians were killed or wounded on Monday as desperate crowds headed toward food distribution points and airdropped parcels in the Gaza Strip, according to witnesses and local health officials.\n\nIsrael's blockade and military offensive have made it nearly impossible to safely deliver aid, contributing to the territory's slide toward famine nearly 22 months into the war with Hamas. Aid groups say Israel's week-old measures to allow more aid in are far from sufficient. Families of hostages in Gaza fear starvation affects them too, but blame Hamas.\n\nHamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nSeveral hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since May while heading toward food distribution sites and aid convoys, according to witnesses, local health officials and the United Nations human rights office. The military says it has only fired warning shots and disputes the toll.\n\nAs international alarm has mounted, several countries have airdropped aid over Gaza. The U.N. and aid groups call such drops costly and dangerous for residents, and say they deliver far less aid than trucks.\n\nMany food parcels dropped by air have splashed into the Mediterranean Sea or landed in so-called red zones from which Israel's military has ordered people to evacuate. In either case, Palestinians risk their lives to get flour and other basic goods.\n\nOn Monday, Palestinians cheered as pallets of aid were parachuted over Zuweida in central Gaza. Associated Press footage showed a desperate scramble when the parcels hit the ground, with hundreds of people racing toward them. Fistfights broke out and some men wielded batons.\n\n\"I wish they would deliver it through the (land) crossings,\" Rabah Rabah said earlier as he waited for the airdrop. \"This is inhuman.\"\n\nAt least one parcel fell on a tent where displaced people had been sheltering, injuring a man who was taken to a hospital. His condition was not immediately known.\n\nAt least 16 people were killed late Sunday near the Israeli-controlled Zikim Crossing, the main entry point for aid to northern Gaza, according to records at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, which showed that more than 130 people were wounded.\n\nThe circumstances were not immediately clear, but the crossing has seen several shootings in recent days that witnesses and health officials blamed on Israeli forces. There was no immediate comment from the military.\n\nAt least 10 people were killed as thousands waited for aid trucks in the Morag Corridor, which the Israeli military carved out between the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.\n\nMohammed al-Masri, who was among the crowds, said Israeli forces opened fire when a group of young men tried to make their way to the front. \"The occupation forces shot many people in the head and in the back,\" he said, adding that he saw four wounded people, one motionless on the ground.\n\nNasser Hospital in Khan Younis said it received 10 bodies from Morag and another five who were killed near an aid site in southern Gaza run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor.\n\nGHF said there were no violent incidents at or near its sites. It said a new U.N. route runs near two of its sites in the south and has drawn large crowds of people who unload the convoys. GHF says its contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots on a few occasions to prevent deadly crowding since it opened four sites in May.\n\nAl-Awda Hospital in central Gaza said it received the bodies of eight people killed near a GHF site in the Israeli-controlled Netzarim Corridor, and that another 50 people were wounded. Witnesses and health officials said Israeli forces had fired toward the crowds.\n\nAn Associated Press photo showed a man carrying a body away from the site, as others hauled bags of food.\n\n\"It's like yesterday, and the day before,\" said Ayman Ruqab, a young Palestinian who said he had tried unsuccessfully to reach the site for the past three days. \"It's a death trap.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said it fired warning shots at people who approached \"in a manner that posed a threat to the troops,\" without elaborating. It said it was not aware of any casualties.\n\nHamas-led terrorists killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. They still hold 50 hostages, around 20 of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military offensive has killed more than 60,900 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says around half the dead have been women and children, is staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and other independent experts view its figures as the most reliable casualty count.\n\nIsrael has disputed the figures but hasn't provided its own.",

        "title": "Now streaming and on DVD: 'Accountant 2' gives Ben Affleck better returns",
        "body": "Sioux City Journal entertainment editor Bruce Miller says that although \"The Accountant 2\" is a good buddy film, this sequel could use an audit.\n\nIf you had to itemize Ben Affleck's career, you'd probably pick folks going through a crisis -- not the superheroes -- as his real strength.\n\nWhile it's no \"Argo,\" \"The Accountant 2\" lets him dig a little deeper into drama than his Batman run ever it. Here, he and Jon Bernthal return as brothers caught up in a wide-ranging drug case.\n\nWhile Affleck's Christian Wolff is a socially inept accountant with a side hustle as an assassin, Bernthal's Braxton is much more adept at working the angles and confronting the bad guys.\n\nThe two are pulled into a case after the death of a former director of the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. As they dig a little deeper, they discover a trafficking situation that, apparently, is minutes from blowing sky high.\n\nWhen the two finally get to pause (atop Christian's Airstream), you realize much of director Gavin O'Connor's story requires clues to magically present themselves. Cynthia Addai-Robinson as the dead man's successor takes a much more audience-friendly approach to connecting the dots. She has a wall of suspects (do all investigators do this?) and plenty of \"strings attached\" situations.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The new creature everyone is talking about Fear led former Wisconsin runners to wait to speak out about former coach, athletes say\n\nBefore the Wolff brothers even get to the deeper tragedy, they've got to break a lot of bones and shed a lot of blood. More interesting than that journey is the way a group of oh-so-smart kids can find information and get it to the good guys before it's too late.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\n\"Accountant 2\" suggests there's a quick way to discover everything. It's just a matter of finding the source and zooming in.\n\nIn this film's case, a woman from Iowa takes a selfie on the street. The kids find her phone, hack its contents, enlarge the photo and find a person in the background who was a key witness to a whole lot of trouble. In seconds, they've tracked her down and begun a bigger hunt.\n\nIt's fascinating to watch -- particularly since this \"Big Brother\" view of cellphones is routinely pooh-poohed by those in charge. Still, the method does draw concern and hints at a bigger story.\n\nThe brothers don't tackle that (a sequel is likely) but they do suggest there's a place for their brand of justice, if it's tied to the right side.\n\nBernthal shows more personality than Affleck but Affleck gets the lighter lift. When he does go out of his comfort zone (to try speed-dating and line dancing), he makes this more than his franchise version of \"John Wick\" or any number of those Liam Neeson films.\n\n\"The Accountant 2\" is as predictable as overly violent films get. It doesn't look for the grays in situations and winds up with a sense of completion once the right target is found. When that happens, all seems right in the world -- even though little that precedes the situation doesn't really make sense.\n\nNo doubt, a third installment will emerge. This one, though, reminds us of a better Affleck and the roles he used to play.\n\nStay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

        "body": "The New York Yankees aren't playing good baseball right now.\n\nThe Yankees have been in a funk for most of the summer, going 18-27 over their last 45 games. They've lost nine games in the AL East standings during that time, falling from first place to third place.\n\nLosing AL MVP candidate Aaron Judge to the injured list hasn't helped, but New York's also been hurting itself with sloppy play and careless mistakes, contributing to an ugly three-game sweep at the hands of the Miami Marlins over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the Boston Red Sox are surging. They're 11 games over .500 after sweeping the Houston Astros, passing the Yankees in the standings.\n\nWith his old team on a roll, Red Sox legend and NESN analyst Jonathan Papelbon ripped New York in a social media post on Sunday.\n\n\"I feel a shift happening @Yankees are playing lazy and making a bunch of stupid mistakes and @RedSox are playing with grit and grind !!! #GritandGrind,\" wrote the former reliever on X.\n\nThe Yankees made multiple brutal miscues against the Marlins over the weekend, including a costly fielding error by José Caballero and a baserunning blunder by Jazz Chisholm Jr.\n\nPapelbon wasn't the only former player to call out New York. Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez both criticized their old team on national television Saturday before the MLB Speedway Classic.\n\n\"They make way too many mistakes,\" Jeter said. \"Way too many mistakes, and you can't get away making that number of mistakes against great teams. It just doesn't happen.\"\n\nJeter's right on that front, as the Yankees were exposed by the Los Angeles Dodgers during last year's World Series.\n\nIt appears they still haven't learned their lesson. If they don't turn things around soon, they could be at risk of falling out of the playoff race.",

        "title": "One Fiesta: Two Rodeos, Two Different Ways to Have Fun",
        "body": "Despite the drama surrounding this year's Fiesta rodeo, the show went on ... in two locations. For the first time in the history of the Fiesta rodeo, the official Old Spanish Days Stock Horse Show and Rodeo took place outside the city limits at the Santa Ynez Valley Equestrian Center, featuring an amateur rodeo competition. The Earl Warren Show Grounds, where the Old Spanish Days rodeo traditionally had been held, presented this year what it called the Santa Barbara Rodeo Days, run by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA).\n\nEarl Warren's rodeo featured highly skilled professional ropers and riders who tour around the country competing in traditional timed events. The two hour show included team and breakaway roping, bronco riding, steer wrestling, bull-riding, barrel racing, and mutton busting. Tickets started at $45 for general admission - more for box seating - plus $20 for parking. Also on the grounds was a free carnival, but with pay-for rides and games, complete with a Ferris wheel. A cash bar and food stands lined the walkways.\n\nLike most PRCA rodeos, the evening began with the unfurling of an enormous American flag as the announcer said a prayer. Between the skilled contests, a rodeo clown bantered with the crowd, performing stunts and encouraging the audience to cheer and drink. The deejay blasted sing-along-songs such as \"Come on Eileen\" with the audience singing the chorus enthusiastically. The announcer threw quippy comments when bull and bronco riders hit the ground. The energy was high among the young crowd, mostly 20 and 30 year olds, a few with kids in tow.\n\nPrizes were given away to audience members, including a Yeti cooler to the rowdiest crowd member, which on Friday, was an eleven-year-old boy who was jumping and yelling all night. Josiah Jenkins, who had participated for many years with the Old Spanish Day's rodeo, and in fact, was running the Santa Ynez rodeo this year, was honored at the Earl Warren event for his riding skills and for his 50 years of participation in Fiesta.\n\nJunior riders competed in a mutton busting competition. hanging on as long as they could. But the real star of the show was pro rider Lefty Holman from Visalia taking the win of the night's bronco riding competition.\n\nAfter the show was over, the crowd funneled out while the bronc horses ran free in the arena to the tune of John Denver's \"Country Roads\". Some of the audience stayed for another round from the bar and a line dancing lesson from Borderline Bar instructors.\n\nIt was a different tune at the Old Spanish Days Stock Horse Show and Rodeo out in Santa Ynez. A free event -- free parking too -- in a casual setting that felt more like a local horse show than a production. Riders from Santa Ynez to Ojai competed in a friendly, yet fierce, competition.\n\nOn Saturday, most of the afternoon was spent on team penning where a herd of steers with different numbers marked on their backs were roaming around the arena while a team of three riders are given a number and 90 seconds to cut their numbered steers out of the herd and into a pen. The competition was intense but friendly, the teams bantering with one another as they awaited their turns in the ring. People in the audience were yelling encouragement and advice.\n\nBetween their rides, cowboys and cowgirls parked behind the bleachers, their horses mingling with seated audience members. Road apples lined the walkway and horses munched on hay bales. The crowds were smaller than at Earl Warren, with many families with kids, including Clint Eastwood's son Scott with his family.\n\nBut the event that filled the stands was the 5 p.m. mutton busting. Twice the number of young competitors showed up than at Earl Warren the night before, and parents and friends lined the rail. With ages ranging from about four to ten, most of the competitors held on for about two strides, barely making it out of the box. That did not stop the crowd from roaring. Colorful lassos were handed out as prizes.\n\nFollowing the events Saturday night, there was a sold out BBQ with free plates for competitors and $30 a plate for spectators. A live band played as diners were served from the buffet line. Parents had to wrangle their kids to the dinner table from the lawn where they were roping a trash can, and each other.\n\nProviding two different feels, both rodeos were full of fun for crowds and competitors. Some missed having a united event with amateur and pro rodeo in one location as it had been in years past, but that didn't prevent them from having a good time.",

        "body": "iOS 26, currently in beta, gives you two distinct ways to add websites to your iPhone's Home screen - as web apps or traditional bookmarks. They might look similar at first glance, but choosing the right option can dramatically improve how you access your favorite sites.\n\nWhen you add a website to your Home screen via Safari's \"Add to Home Screen\" option, iOS 26 automatically detects whether the site supports progressive web app (PWA) functionality. Web apps run almost like native apps, with features like offline access, push notifications, and a streamlined interface without Safari's address bar. In contrast, traditional bookmarks simply open the website in Safari when tapped.\n\nThis choice matters more than you might think. Web apps can provide a faster, more app-like experience, whereas bookmarks work better for informational sites you visit only occasionally.\n\nIf a website supports PWA functionality, iOS 26 will automatically offer the web app option when you try to add it to your Home screen.\n\nWeb apps appear on your Home screen with a dedicated icon, and tapping it will launch the site in its own window without Safari's browser interface. Bookmarks display with a generic website icon or the site's favicon, and tapping them opens the page in Safari.\n\niOS 26 and iPadOS 26 are set for a general release in September 2025.",

        "title": "The landmark Supreme Court case that saved the press - and why the Trump admin wants it gone",
        "body": "President Donald Trump is again attacking the American press - this time not with fiery rally speeches or by calling the media \"the enemy of the people,\" but through the courts.\n\nSince the heat of the November 2024 election, and continuing into July, Trump has filed defamation lawsuits against \"60 Minutes\" broadcaster CBS News and The Wall Street Journal. He has also sued the Des Moines Register for publishing a poll just before the 2024 election that Trump alleges exaggerated support for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and thus constituted election interference and fraud.\n\nThese are in addition to other lawsuits Trump filed against the news media during his first term and during his years out of office between 2021 and 2025.\n\nAt the heart of Trump's complaints is a familiar refrain: The media is not only biased, but dishonest, corrupt and dangerous.\n\nThe president isn't just upset about reporting on him that he thinks is unfair. He wants to redefine what counts as libel and make it easier for public officials to sue for damages. A libel suit is a civil tort claim seeking damages when a person believes something false has been printed or broadcast about them and so harmed their reputation.\n\nRedefining libel in this way would require overturning the Supreme Court's 1964 ruling in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, one of the most important First Amendment legal rulings in American constitutional history\n\nTrump made overturning Sullivan a talking point during his first campaign for president; his lawsuits now put that threat into action. And they raise the question: What happened in Sullivan, and why does it still matter?\n\nWhat Sullivan was about\n\nAs chair of a public policy institute devoted to strengthening deliberative democracy, I have written two books about the media and the presidency, and another about media ethics. My research traces how news institutions shape civic life and why healthy democracies rely on free expression.\n\nIn 1960, The New York Times published a full-page advertisement titled \"Heed Their Rising Voices\". The ad, which included an appeal for readers to send money in support of Martin Luther King Jr. and the movement against Jim Crow, described brutal and unjust treatment of Black students and protesters in Montgomery, Alabama. It also emphasized episodes of police violence against peaceful demonstrations.\n\nThe ad was not entirely accurate in its description of the behavior of either protesters or the police.\n\nIt claimed, for instance, that activists had sung \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" on the steps of the state capitol during a rally, when they actually had sung the national anthem. It said that \"truckloads of police armed with shotguns and tear-gas\" had \"ringed\" a college campus, when the police had only been deployed nearby. And it asserted that King had been arrested seven times in Alabama, when the real number was four.\n\nThough the ad did not identify any individual public officials by name, it disparaged the behavior of Montgomery police.\n\nThat's where L.B. Sullivan came in.\n\nAs Montgomery's police commissioner, he oversaw the police department. Sullivan claimed that because the ad maligned the conduct of law enforcement, it had implicitly defamed him. In 1960 in Alabama, a primary defense against libel was truth. But since there were mistakes in the ad, a truth defense could not be raised. Sullivan sued for damages, and an Alabama jury awarded him US$500,000, equivalent to $5,450,000 in 2025.\n\nThe message to the press was clear: criticize Southern officials and risk being sued out of existence.\n\nIn fact, the Sullivan lawsuit was not an isolated incident, but part of a broader strategy. In addition to Sullivan, four other Montgomery officials filed suits against the Times.\n\nIn Birmingham, public officials filed seven libel lawsuits over Times reporter Harrison Salisbury's trenchant reporting about racism in that city. The lawsuits helped push the Times to the edge of bankruptcy. Salisbury was even indicted for seditious libel and faced up to 21 years in prison.\n\nAlabama officials also sued CBS, The Associated Press, the Saturday Evening Post and Ladies' Home Journal - all for reporting on civil rights and the South's brutal response.\n\nWriting for the court, Justice William Brennan held that public officials cannot prevail in defamation lawsuits merely by showing that statements are false. Instead, they must prove such statements are made with \"actual malice\". Actual malice means a reporter or press outlet knew their story was false or else acted with reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nThe decision set a high bar.\n\nBefore the ruling, the First Amendment's protections for speech and the press didn't offer much help to the press in libel cases.\n\nAfter it, public officials who wanted to sue the press would have to prove \"actual malice\" - real, purposeful untruths that caused harm. Honest mistakes weren't enough to prevail in such lawsuits. The court held that errors are inevitable in public debate and that protecting those mistakes is essential to keeping debate open and free.\n\nNonviolent protest and the press\n\nIn essence, the court ruling blocked government officials from suing for libel with ulterior motives.\n\nKing and other civil rights leaders relied on a strategy of nonviolent protest to expose injustice through public, visible actions.\n\nWhen protesters were arrested, beaten or hosed in the streets, their goal was not chaos - it was clarity. They wanted the nation to see what Southern oppression looked like. For that, they needed press coverage.\n\nIf Sullivan's lawsuit had succeeded, it could have bullied the press away from covering civil rights altogether. The Supreme Court recognized this danger.\n\nPublic officials treated differently\n\nAnother key element of the court's reasoning was its distinction between public officials and private citizens.\n\nElected leaders, the court said, can use mass media to defend themselves in ways ordinary people cannot.\n\n\"The public official certainly has equal if not greater access than most private citizens to media of communication,\" Justice Brennan wrote in the Sullivan ruling.\n\nTrump is a perfect example of this dynamic. He masterfully uses social media, rallies, televised interviews and impromptu remarks to push back. He doesn't need the courts.\n\nGiving public officials the power to sue over news stories they dislike could well create a chilling effect on the media that undermines government accountability and distorts public discourse.\n\n\"The theory of our Constitution is that every citizen may speak his mind and every newspaper express its view on matters of public concern and may not be barred from speaking or publishing because those in control of government think that what is said or written is unwise,\" Brennan wrote.\n\n\"In a democratic society, one who assumes to act for the citizens in an executive, legislative, or judicial capacity must expect that his official acts will be commented upon and criticized.\"\n\nWhy Sullivan still matters\n\nThe Sullivan ruling is more than a legal doctrine. It is a shared agreement about the kind of democracy Americans aspire to. It affirms a press duty to hold power to account, and a public right to hear facts and information that those in power want to suppress.\n\nThe ruling protects the right to criticize those in power and affirms that the press is not a nuisance, but an essential part of a functioning democracy. It ensures that political leaders cannot insulate themselves from scrutiny by silencing their critics through intimidation or litigation.\n\nTrump's lawsuits seek to undo these press protections. He presents himself as the victim of a dishonest press and hopes to use the legal system to punish those he perceives to be his detractors.\n\nThe decision in the Sullivan case reminds Americans that democracy doesn't depend on leaders who feel comfortable. It depends on a public that is free to speak.",

        "title": "Is an older luxury vehicle a better deal than a lightly used mainstream car?",
        "body": "Ronald Montoya for CarMax\n\nIs an older luxury vehicle a better deal than a lightly used mainstream car?\n\nShopping for a car can sometimes make buyers choose between features they want versus features that would be \"nice to have.\" But what if there was a way to get a luxury car for the same price as a mainstream model?\n\nConsider this scenario: You have a $30,000 budget for your next car. You've been looking into a one-year-old 2024 Toyota Camry, a highly rated midsize sedan. For that price, you're probably looking at the SE trim level, which includes features such as a four-cylinder engine, synthetic leather seats, 18-inch wheels, automatic climate control, and a rearview camera.\n\nPeople are also reading... Second act for Sioux City's Red Room Lounge is a family matter Hausmann Construction sues Woodbury County, jail board, architects, project manager; County denies claims South Sioux City man charged with stomping on woman's head Sioux City says 'ciao' to lone Fazoli's location Two Siouxland activist groups holding march and rally on Saturday Iowa gaming revenue dips for 3rd consecutive year Former Jewish Community Center could be donated to city for $1 Woodbury County Fair selects its Royal Court Former U.S. Capitol police officer slams Republican Iowa Senate District 1 candidate Wind gusts of up to 99 mph slam Siouxland, knocking out power, downing trees, damaging structures 'A transformational guy': Osborne leaves legacy at Bishop Heelan baseball program Judge reaches verdict for Sioux City woman charged with killing mother Sioux Center man killed in 2-vehicle crash near Inwood Staff shakeups for governor's office Macy man faces federal sexual assault charges\n\nBut if you're willing to consider a slightly older vehicle, the Lexus ES 350 actually shares much of the same DNA as the Camry (Toyota and Lexus are owned by the same company). This means that even if you choose a Lexus that's five years older than the Camry, you might find a nicer car for the same price. The Lexus offers many of the same modern features, a smoother ride, a more powerful engine, a nicer interior, and, of course, that luxury badge.\n\nLexus luxury at a Toyota price point? It's a tempting proposition. But is it the smarter choice? Read on, as CarMax examines the pros and cons of buying a lightly used mainstream car versus an older luxury vehicle.\n\nLightly Used Mainstream CarPros\n\nLess wear and tear: A newer mainstream-brand car will only have a few thousand miles on it and need minimal servicing.\n\nLonger warranty: Most non-luxury cars come with at least a three-year limited warranty and a five-year warranty for the powertrain. This means you'll have some coverage for the next couple of years.\n\nNewer technology: The newer car will benefit from the latest technology and features. These features can range from better smartphone integration to adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking.\n\nLess maintenance: A relatively newer car should need minimal servicing such as oil changes and tire rotations. If something does break down, it should be covered under the remainder of the new-car warranty.\n\nBetter depreciation: Depreciation can vary wildly from one vehicle to the next, but in general, the newer non-luxury vehicle should hold its value better over time compared to the older luxury model. The idea is that luxury buyers tend to want the newest thing, so as the luxury vehicle ages, it begins to lose its luster more quickly.\n\nCons\n\nNot as flashy: The newer car will get you where you need to go, but it won't have the same presence as a luxury vehicle.\n\nPaying more for less: In general, the non-luxury vehicle will have fewer features than its luxury counterpart. With the vehicles we're comparing, for example, the Lexus offers backup sensors, a sunroof, full leatherette seats, remote start, and nearly 100 more horsepower from its engine. You can get those features on the Camry, but you'd need to spend more for a higher trim level.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOlder Luxury VehiclePros\n\nNicer styling: Opinions on styling are subjective, but most luxury vehicles tend to look better than their non-luxury counterparts. On the inside, luxury cars are often filled with nicer materials, such as real wood trim, soft-touch plastics, and aluminum inserts.\n\nNicer to drive: Luxury vehicles tend to have larger or more powerful engines and more comfortable suspension systems when compared to their mainstream equivalents, which means that they'll likely handle better and glide over imperfections on the road. Similarly, because they tend to be more powerful, luxury vehicles will have quicker acceleration and be a little more entertaining to drive.\n\nLoaner access: If you take your luxury vehicle to the dealership for service and it needs to be in the shop for a while, many brands will offer one of their loaner or \"courtesy\" vehicles for you to drive in the meantime.\n\nCons\n\nLittle or no warranty: Luxury brands tend to have longer warranties in general, but depending on the age of the car you're interested in, it may be near the end (or out) of its warranty coverage.\n\nMore maintenance: The older luxury vehicle will often have more mileage and has had more time for wear and tear to set in. As a result, it is more likely to be closer to major maintenance milestones when costlier items need to be replaced. For example, the Edmunds True Cost to Own (TCO) tool estimates that a 2024 Toyota Camry would cost $3,931 to maintain over five years, while the 2019 Lexus ES 350 would cost $9,216.\n\nOlder technology: The ES 350 in the example features a trackpad control interface for the center screen, while the Camry has a simpler touchscreen layout. Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ integration are not supported in this Lexus, which means you'd need to rely solely on Bluetooth® audio. However, Lexus does offer a factory retrofit for some of its models, and the 2019 ES can be fitted with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as long as the vehicle didn't come with the factory navigation system.\n\nLess fuel-efficient: Since luxury vehicles are often heavier and tend to come with more powerful engines, they are often less fuel-efficient than non-luxury vehicles. For example, the Camry's four-cylinder engine gets an EPA-estimated 32 mpg combined, while the ES 350's V6-powered engine gets an EPA-estimated 26 mpg combined.\n\nIf you drive about 13,500 miles a year and assume current fuel prices, this translates to roughly $350 per year in added fuel costs in the Lexus, according to the EPA.\n\nAdditionally, some luxury vehicles might require premium fuel, while non-luxury vehicles typically do not. This factor could make the difference in fuel costs even more dramatic.\n\nWhile it's true that you can often get elegant styling, a more powerful engine, and a nicer interior for about the same price as an older luxury vehicle, this doesn't necessarily translate to a better value because these vehicles are generally more expensive to own. If keeping costs down is your primary goal, then it's probably best to pass on the luxury car.\n\nThat said, a decision like this may not always come down to dollars and cents.\n\nCars -- or any luxury item, really -- tend to be emotional purchases. We buy something pricier than it needs to be, based on our perception of quality and how it makes us feel. If that luxury car on the lot makes you feel good and you know what you're getting into, then by all means, go for it.\n\nEdmunds is a wholly owned subsidiary of CarMax.\n\nThis story was produced by CarMax and reviewed and distributed by Stacker.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nOriginally published on carmax.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.\n\nThe business news you need\n\nGet the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

        "body": "After seeing just one of its teams make the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff, the Big 12 enters the 2025 college football season with some pressure on its shoulders.\n\nThe conference is still looking for its first national championship since the 2005 season, when Texas, now with the SEC, beat USC to claim the BCS title. Twenty years later, Arizona State -- coming off its first College Football Playoff berth -- is once again expected to lead the way in the Big 12 following its breakthrough debut a season ago.\n\nLed by quarterback Sam Leavitt and wide receiver Jordyn Tyson on offense, Kenny Dillingham's Sun Devils are ranked No. 11 in the preseason US LBM Coaches Poll that was released on Monday, Aug. 4. Four other Big 12 teams found their name among the preseason top 25, while several others received votes.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Deion Sanders on Colorado starting QB battle: 'I don't know which one will start'\n\nAmong that latter group, unranked Colorado received the second-fewest votes among five Big 12 teams. The 2025 season will be the toughest challenge yet for Deion Sanders in Boulder, with Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders off to the NFL with the Jaguars and Browns, respectively. One key question going into fall camp for the Buffaloes has been who will be the starting quarterback in Week 1 vs. Georgia Tech: Julian Lewis or Kaidon Salter?\n\nHere's a look at where Big 12 teams came in on the preseason US LBM Coaches Poll on Monday:\n\nBig 12 teams bolded.

Limited, which is Shein's Dublin-based European manager.\n\nItalian officials accused the company of \"misleading and/or deceptive environmental messages and claims.\"\n\nShein claimed a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by some 25% by 2030, with a 2050 goal to reach net zero.

        "title": "Substack's Algorithm Accidentally Reveals What We Already Knew: It's The Nazi Bar Now",
        "body": "Back in April 2023, when Substack CEO Chris Best refused to answer basic questions about whether his platform would allow racist content, I noted that his evasiveness was essentially hanging out a \"Nazis Welcome\" sign. By December, when the company doubled down and explicitly said they'd continue hosting and monetizing Nazi newsletters, they'd fully embraced their reputation as the Nazi bar.\n\nLast week, we got a perfect demonstration of what happens when you build your platform's reputation around welcoming Nazis: your recommendation algorithms start treating Nazi content as more than worth tolerating, to content worth promoting.\n\nAs Taylor Lorenz reported on User Mag's Patreon account, Substack sent push notifications to users encouraging them to subscribe to \"NatSocToday,\" a newsletter that \"describes itself as 'a weekly newsletter featuring opinions and news important to the National Socialist and White Nationalist Community.'\"\n\nAs you can see, the notification included the newsletter's swastika logo, leading confused users to wonder why they were getting Nazi symbols pushed to their phones.\n\n\"I had [a swastika] pop up as a notification and I'm like, wtf is this? Why am I getting this?\" one user said. \"I was quite alarmed and blocked it.\" Some users speculated that Substack had issued the push alert intentionally in order to generate engagement or that it was tied to Substack's recent fundraising round. Substack is primarily funded by Andreessen Horowitz, a firm whose founders have pushed extreme far right rhetoric.\n\n\"I thought that Substack was just for diaries and things like that,\" a user who posted about receiving the alert on his Instagram story told User Mag. \"I didn't realize there was such a prominent presence of the far right on the app.\"\n\nSubstack's response was predictable corporate damage control:\n\n\"We discovered an error that caused some people to receive push notifications they should never have received,\" a spokesperson told User Mag. \"In some cases, these notifications were extremely offensive or disturbing. This was a serious error, and we apologize for the distress it caused.\"\n\nBut here's the thing about algorithmic \"errors\" -- they reveal the underlying patterns your system has learned. Recommendation algorithms don't randomly select content to promote. They surface content based on engagement metrics: subscribers, likes, comments, and growth patterns. When Nazi content consistently hits those metrics, the algorithm learns to treat it as successful content worth promoting to similar users.\n\nThere may be some randomness involved, and algorithms aren't perfectly instructive of how a system has been trained, but it at least raises some serious questions about what Substack thinks people will like based on its existing data.\n\nAs Lorenz notes, the Nazi newsletter that got promoted has \"746 subscribers and hundreds of collective likes on Substack Notes.\" More troubling, users who clicked through were recommended \"related content from another Nazi newsletter called White Rabbit,\" which has over 8,600 subscribers and \"is also being recommended on the Substack app through its 'rising' leaderboard.\"\n\nThis isn't a bug. It's a feature working exactly as designed. Substack's recommendation systems are doing precisely what they're built to do: identify content that performs well within the platform's ecosystem and surface it to potentially interested users. The \"error\" isn't that the algorithm malfunctioned -- it's that Substack created conditions where Nazi content could thrive well enough to trigger promotional systems in the first place.\n\nWhen you build a platform that explicitly welcomes Nazi content, don't act surprised when that content performs well enough to trigger your promotional systems. When you've spent years defending your decision to help Nazis monetize their content, you can't credibly claim to be \"disturbed\" when your algorithms recognize that Nazi content is succeeding on your platform.\n\nThe real tell here isn't the push notification itself -- it's that Substack's discovery systems are apparently treating Nazi newsletters as content worth surfacing to new users. That suggests these publications aren't just surviving on Substack, they're thriving well enough to register as \"rising\" content worthy of algorithmic promotion.\n\nThis is the inevitable endpoint of Substack's content moderation philosophy. You can't spend years positioning yourself as the platform that won't \"censor\" Nazi content, actively help those creators monetize, and then act shocked when your systems start treating that content as editorially valuable.\n\nThis distinction matters enormously in terms of what sort of speech you are endorsing: there's a world of difference between passively hosting speech and actively promoting it. When Substack defended hosting Nazi newsletters, they could claim they were simply providing infrastructure for discourse. But push notifications and algorithmic recommendations are something different -- they're editorial decisions about what content deserves amplification and which users might be interested in it.\n\nTo be clear, that's entirely protected speech under the First Amendment as all editorial choices are protected. Substack is allowed to promote Nazis. But they should really stop pretending they don't mean to. They've made it clear that they welcome literal Nazis on their platform and now it's been made clear that their algorithm recognizes that Nazi content performs well.\n\nThis isn't about Substack \"supporting free speech\" -- it's about Substack's own editorial speech and what it's choosing to say. They're not just saying \"Nazis welcome.\" They're saying \"we think other people will like Nazi content too.\"\n\nAnd the public has every right to use their own free speech to call out and condemn such a choice. And use their own free speech rights of association to say \"I won't support Substack\" because of this.\n\nAll the corporate apologies in the world can't change what their algorithms revealed: when you welcome Nazis, you become the Nazi bar. And when you become the Nazi bar, your systems start working to bring more customers to the Nazis.\n\nYour reputation remains what you allow. But it's even more strongly connected to what you actively promote.",

        "body": "The Ukrainian government responded to President Donald Trump redeploying two nuclear-powered submarines \"in the region\" to deter Russia, saying the move had shut up Kremlin loudmouths.\n\nTop Volodymyr Zelensky ally Andriy Yermak praised President Trump's submarine redeployment on Monday morning, stating \"the concept of 'peace through strength' works... Russia understands only force\".\n\nPresident Trump had first floated the nuclear submarine deterrent on Friday in response to a combative and threatening message published by Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian President who found a new place in semi-retirement on the national security council, and on social media as threat-maker in chief. On Thursday, Medvedev responded to remarks by President Trump by twisting a metaphor about American zombie-genre films, warning of danger to America and stating \"Russia is right in everything and will continue to go its own way\".\n\nYet as observed by Ukraine, since this outburst and President Trump's steely response the usual constant output from Medvedev on his various social media channels has totally evaporated. Medvedev hadn't even featured on Russian state media for days until Monday morning, and even then only as the Kremlin made a statement to play down Medvedev's importance, insisting he can be safely ignored and that the only official pronouncements on Russian nuclear doctrine come from President Vladimir Putin himself.\n\nAs caustically observed by Ukraine's Yermak, Trump's submarine threat saw \"one Russian alcoholic who had promised nuclear war in his X immediately fell silent\".\n\nFollowing Trump's earlier comment that \"A threat was made by a former president of Russia and we're going to protect our people\" he added taht the redeployment of two U.S. nuclear submarines was now complete and \"they are in the region\" now, \"where they have to be\".\n\nLast month President Trump imposed and then shortened a deadline on the Russian Federation to come to the negotiating table over the Ukraine war, with its period of grace ending this Friday, August 8th. The United States is to enter into last-minute talks with Russia to facilitate a hoped-for about-face from Moscow, and President Trump confirmed overnight, stating special envoy Steve Witkoff would be heading to Moscow \"Wednesday or Thursday\".\n\nIf no deal is reached, Russia faces heavy secondary tariffs, a new concept by President Trump that would see heavy levies placed not on Russia itself but that which keeps its economy alive, its international customers. China and India remain major markets for exported Russian energy like oil and gas.\n\nTo avoid China getting hammered with tariffs, Russia will need to \"get a deal where people stop getting killed\" this week, Trump said.",

It's roughly 25 miles west of Butte and 80 miles southwest of Helena, Montana's capital.\n\nWho is the shooting suspect?\n\nLaw enforcement identified Michael Brown as the suspected shooter.\n\nBrown served in the U.S. Army from 2001 to 2005 and had been deployed at least once to Iraq. He was in the National Guard from 2006 to 2009 and his last known rank was sergeant.\n\nHe lived in a home next door to the Owl Bar, authorities said. According to an initial online records search, Brown is a 1998 high school graduate with no listed criminal record.\n\nWilliam Leonard Brown, a brother of Michael Brown, fatally stabbed a man in Anaconda-Deer Lodge County in 2000. He was sentenced in January 2002 to 100 years in prison and is now held at the Saguero Correctional Center, a private prison in Arizona, according to the Montana Department of Corrections.\n\nWhere was the suspect last seen?\n\nAs of Monday morning, Brown was still at large, believed to be on foot in the mountains just west of Anaconda.\n\nHe was last seen around 2 p.m. Friday driving west of Anaconda on Stumptown Road. He was believed to be driving a stolen white Ford F-150 pickup. Authorities located the truck on Friday, but Brown was still at large.\n\nAuthorities released a still surveillance photo of Brown that was taken at some point after the fatal shooting Friday and it appeared he was barefoot and only had shorts on.\n\nBut Knudsen said Brown fled the area in the stolen Ford pickup that had camping gear and clothing in it, and believe he was clothed when he ditched the truck and scampered by foot into the mountains.\n\n\"At this point we have a reason to believe the suspect is fully clothed, shoes on his feet and able to get around,\" Knudsen said.\n\nBrown was last seen wearing a black shirt, possibly with blue flames at the bottom, gray or blue pants and an orange bandana.\n\nWhat have search efforts entailed?\n\nAttorney General Austin Knudsen said Sunday morning more than 250 law enforcement officers from numerous local, state and federal agencies were involved in the manhunt. Helicopters with infrared technology and other assets were deployed.\n\nSearch efforts were concentrated in the Stumptown Road area and the surrounding mountain range. Stumptown Road was closed at Evergreen Street and a nearby gravel road leads towards Hearst Lake in the Mount Haggin area of the Anaconda-Pintler Range.\n\nAt one point Sunday evening, an armored SWAT truck from Butte-Silver Bow County followed by several police vehicles were seen heading west on Highway 1 and possibly turned into an area along Stumptown Road where reports suggested Brown might have been seen.\n\nDrones and helicopters also flew above, but as darkness fell, there was still no official word on a capture.\n\nBill Everett, chief executive officer of Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, said is impressed with the quality of the search teams working the manhunt.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"My confidence is very good that they've got the best of the best here,\" Everett told The Montana Standard early Sunday morning.\n\nAre there any restrictions in place in the Anaconda area?\n\nAccording to a Saturday public service update from authorities, Anaconda is not on lockdown.\n\nLaw enforcement has urged residents to avoid the Stumptown Road area and \"remain cautious and vigilant.\"\n\nAnaconda Deer Lodge Police Chief Bill Sather issued a statement on video Saturday afternoon posted on the Montana DOJ Facebook page, telling residents it was \"OK to go about your business but, please use caution.\"\n\nHe thanked residents for their patience during this \"stressful and tragic time in our community\" and expressed condolences to friends and family of the victims.\n\nEverett said Sunday that some residents in the Stumptown Road area were initially evacuated but they have been allowed to return to their homes.\n\nWho are the victims?\n\nThe names of the four victims were released Sunday. They are 59-year-old Daniel Edwin Baillie, 64-year-old Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 70-year-old David Allen Leach, and 74-year-old Tony Wayne Palm.\n\nAll four were residents of Anaconda.\n\nKnudsen said authorities believe Brown was a regular at the bar and likely knew the victims.\n\nWhat was the shooter's motive?\n\nAuthorities have not released any information regarding the shooter's motive.\n\nGwerder, owner of the Owl Bar, said he was not aware of any conflicts between Brown and the victims.\n\nHe told the Associated Press that Brown \"knew everyone that was in the bar. I guarantee you that. He didn't have a running dispute with any of them.

        "body": "Sixteen-year-old Cooper Lutkenhaus made United States history at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships on Sunday, Aug. 3.\n\nAnd all it took was dialing in some old middle school tactics.\n\nLutkenhaus, who attends Northwest High School in Justin, Texas, made a miraculous comeback at the 800-meter final in Eugene, Oregon, to become the youngest American ever to qualify for the World Track and Field Championships. The rising high school junior was in seventh place with 200 meters to go before rising to runner-up with his time of 1:42:27.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone among winners and losers from U.S. track and field championships\n\n\"I've always kind of had a natural spot with 200 (meters) to go,\" Lutkenhaus told reporters after the race. \"Ever since middle school that's kind of been the spot I've really pushed from. Kind of just decided to go back to middle school tactics with 200 to go and really just give everything I had left.\"\n\nLutkenhaus' time shattered the previous U18 world record, which was set by Kenya's Timothy Kitum at the 2012 London Olympics, by 1.1 seconds.\n\nDonovan Brazier, a 28-year-old from Grand Rapids, Michigan, won the race with a personal-best time of 1:42:16.\n\n\"I saw someone coming up and I was like, 'dang, this could be the high schooler,'\" Brazier told reporters after the race. This kid's phenomenal. I'm glad that I'm 28 and maybe have a few more years left in me, hopefully won't have to deal with him in his prime because that dude is definitely pretty special.\"\n\nLutkenhaus' time not only tops the best for a youth runner ever, but it's also one of the fastest by a U.S. man in history. His time ranks as the fourth-fastest ever by a U.S. man and 18th-fastest ever in the world.\n\nThe previous record for youngest American at track and field worlds was set in 2013 by Mary Cain, who ran at 17 years and 3 months old. Lutkenhaus will shatter the record by youngest U.S. man at the worlds, which is held by Erriyon Knighton, who ran at 18 years and 5 months in 2023.\n\nLutkenhaus' time was so impressive that it would have been the American record before Aug. 10, 2024. Bryce Hoppel set the mark at 1:41.67 after finishing fourth at the 2024 Paris Olympics. There are only three times better than Lutkenhaus' time from Aug. 3 in American history.\n\nLutkenhaus now sets his sights on the world championships in Tokyo in September, where he will be joined by Brazier and Hoppel. The high schooler will certainly make plenty of headlines again at the world's brightest stage.",

        "title": "Now streaming and on DVD: 'Accountant 2' gives Ben Affleck better returns",
        "body": "Sioux City Journal entertainment editor Bruce Miller says that although \"The Accountant 2\" is a good buddy film, this sequel could use an audit.\n\nIf you had to itemize Ben Affleck's career, you'd probably pick folks going through a crisis -- not the superheroes -- as his real strength.\n\nWhile it's no \"Argo,\" \"The Accountant 2\" lets him dig a little deeper into drama than his Batman run ever it. Here, he and Jon Bernthal return as brothers caught up in a wide-ranging drug case.\n\nWhile Affleck's Christian Wolff is a socially inept accountant with a side hustle as an assassin, Bernthal's Braxton is much more adept at working the angles and confronting the bad guys.\n\nThe two are pulled into a case after the death of a former director of the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. As they dig a little deeper, they discover a trafficking situation that, apparently, is minutes from blowing sky high.\n\nWhen the two finally get to pause (atop Christian's Airstream), you realize much of director Gavin O'Connor's story requires clues to magically present themselves. Cynthia Addai-Robinson as the dead man's successor takes a much more audience-friendly approach to connecting the dots. She has a wall of suspects (do all investigators do this?) and plenty of \"strings attached\" situations.\n\nBefore the Wolff brothers even get to the deeper tragedy, they've got to break a lot of bones and shed a lot of blood. More interesting than that journey is the way a group of oh-so-smart kids can find information and get it to the good guys before it's too late.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\n\"Accountant 2\" suggests there's a quick way to discover everything. It's just a matter of finding the source and zooming in.\n\nIn this film's case, a woman from Iowa takes a selfie on the street. The kids find her phone, hack its contents, enlarge the photo and find a person in the background who was a key witness to a whole lot of trouble. In seconds, they've tracked her down and begun a bigger hunt.\n\nIt's fascinating to watch -- particularly since this \"Big Brother\" view of cellphones is routinely pooh-poohed by those in charge. Still, the method does draw concern and hints at a bigger story.\n\nThe brothers don't tackle that (a sequel is likely) but they do suggest there's a place for their brand of justice, if it's tied to the right side.\n\nBernthal shows more personality than Affleck but Affleck gets the lighter lift. When he does go out of his comfort zone (to try speed-dating and line dancing), he makes this more than his franchise version of \"John Wick\" or any number of those Liam Neeson films.\n\n\"The Accountant 2\" is as predictable as overly violent films get. It doesn't look for the grays in situations and winds up with a sense of completion once the right target is found. When that happens, all seems right in the world -- even though little that precedes the situation doesn't really make sense.\n\nNo doubt, a third installment will emerge. This one, though, reminds us of a better Affleck and the roles he used to play.",

Kyiv has strongly denied any involvement.\n\nThe Investigative Committee, Russia's top criminal investigation agency, said in June that it concluded that the attack had been \"planned and carried out in the interests of the current leadership of Ukraine in order to destabilize political situation in our country.\" It also noted the four suspected gunmen tried to flee to Ukraine afterward.\n\nThe four, all identified as citizens of Tajikistan, were arrested hours after the attack and later appeared in a Moscow court with signs of being severely beaten.\n\nThe defendants appearing in court on Monday kept their heads bowed as they sat in the defendants' cage.\n\nThe committee said earlier this year that six other suspects were charged in absentia and placed on Russia´s wanted list for allegedly recruiting and organizing the training of the four. Other defendants in the trial were accused of helping them.",

        "body": "Actor A.J. LoCascio is currently promoting his first book -- a children's book called Spoops: The Little Spirits of Halloween, which was inspired by fans of Voltron. LoCascio was the voice of Prince Lotor on Netflix's Voltron: Legendary Defender from 2016 to 2018, and the part helped launch him into mainstream success. He was at San Diego Comic-Con this year to promote his book launch, among other work, and in an interview with ComicBook, he shared the surprising story of how Voltron fans led him into the children's publishing world. Spoops is available for pre-order now, and hits shelves on Tuesday, August 12th.\n\n\"I love Halloween, and I wanted to make decorations, essentially, for my apartment, but I live in L.A. and you can't just build giant things,\" LoCascio explained. \"So, I started making little sculptures for myself, just to be on my desk, and I was like, 'I love pumpkins, I love everything about Halloween.' That's how it started, and then the show Voltron blew up, and I had photos of these little guys on my desk, and the fans were like, 'How do I buy these? Where do I get these?' And I was like, 'I just made these for me.'\"\n\nOf course, LoCascio couldn't deny fans for long, nor miss this opportunity to share his love for the Halloween spirit. And so, I started to make more,\" he went on. \"I taught myself how to cast and do resin -- stuff like that. And it just kind of took off in its own way.\" At the time of this writing, LoCascio's Etsy shop is empty, but it's clear that his Spoops have sold well over the last seven years.\n\n\"They have their own weird little side-world that they live in, and then of course, people are like, 'What's the lore? What's the story?'\" LoCascio explained. \"And it just became so much that I was like, 'Alright, I'll write this down.' So then I came up with this book, Spoops, and it's about one night -- one Halloween -- where they help a little girl named Holly Hollowell who is not allowed to celebrate Halloween because her parents are anti-Halloween dentists.\"\n\n\"That's like, one of my biggest fears as a kid, is the idea of missing out on trick-or-treating,\" LoCascio confessed. \"I was always afraid I'd get sick, or something would happen. I still have nightmares that I've missed Halloween. That is the worst situation for a kid, to some degree, so I was like, what if that's her issue, and then the Spoops come and help her have a happy Halloween according to her parents' rules, to some degree.\"\n\nA children's book may not be the most obvious career move after a break-out role in the Voltron franchise, but that just makes it all the more special for LoCascio and the fans that are taking this ride with him. Voltron: Legendary Defender is available to digitally rent or purchase on PVOD stores. Spoops: The Little Spirits of Halloween goes on sale on Tuesday, August 12th wherever children's books are sold.",

        "title": "Horticulture Hotline: August yard prep",
        "body": "Although still hot, August is when you have to plan and prepare for how you want your yard to look like in the spring. Weeds? Spring-flowering bulbs? Flower beds with annuals for color? Vegetable garden? Collard greens for Thanksgiving? Fungus? Dead areas? Insects? Transplanting this fall or winter?\n\nTreat for mosquitoes in your yard! Mosquitoes kill millions of people and carry diseases. Usually, I recommend the organic repellents; however, with the amount of rain we have had, try some Mosquito Pro and kill the mosquitoes for months! The growth regulators in this product really extend the length of control of this product. Scout around your yard for potential breeding sights. It is amazing how many places that collect water and a mosquito can lay an egg. Old tarps, tarps on boats, saucers under flower pots, a dent in a trash can lid, old fountain, bird bath, tires, refrigerators, old cars and even half-filled rain gauges all provide enough water to help mosquitoes breed. If you do not have time to do scout your yard, hire a professional and they will help make your yard safe.\n\nLarge Patch fungus has raised its ugly head again in the Lowcountry. The decrease in daylight hours and rain have been great for Large Patch disease to kick in. Water only as needed and apply Strobe Pro G or T-Methyl. Two great systemic control products.\n\nIf you have any bushes or trees that need to be transplanted, you can begin to root prune them. Ideally if you transplant a tree, you would have a ball that is 12 inches for each inch in diameter of the tree (3-inch diameter tree would be 18 inches on either side of the tree). Take a shovel and dig straight down without prying and just sever the roots of the tree. Depending on the size of the tree, whether it was planted or a volunteer seedling, how long it has been in the ground, and whether it is in a group of other plants, will dictate how big of a root ball you will be able to dig. Add some SeaHume and other rooting bio-stimulants to the area to encourage new roots. Root prune now and for the next few months for transplanting in November-January.\n\nIt is getting close to the time to switch over from summer annuals to winter annuals. When amending your annual beds this year, try Back to Nature's Nature's Blend. It's balanced blend of cotton burrs and cattle manure along with alfalfa meal, humates and sulfur will surely make your winter annuals a hit. The alfalfa contains Triacantanol, a natural root growth enhancer and may aid in the control and suppression of certain fungal diseases. Unlike wood and wood by-products, cotton burr and cattle manure do not tie up valuable nutrients in the soil and help neutralize the soils pH. Humate is a great carbon source and has many other benefits to the soil including making nutrients that are tied up in the soil available to the plants. If you are planting bulbs for next spring, consider using Nature's Blend to amend the soil.\n\nThe change in weather will also bring on the winter annual weeds. Are you going to put out ryegrass this fall? Are you going to fight that grassy weed with the white seedhead this spring -- annual blue grass, Poa annua and other winter annual weeds? Now is the time to put out preemergent in your lawn as well as your beds. If you have had Florida Betony in the past, consider using a preemergent that contains Dimension. Many of our customers have noticed a decrease in Florida Betony in lawns that they have used Dimension in late August and again in October. Over twenty years ago, I put out some test plots for Dow AgroSciences, and I saw about an 85 percent reduction in Florida Betony the first year. Dow AgroSciences did not add Florida Betony to the label because of the costs of dealing with the EPA; however, I say: \"Try it, you 'll like it.\"\n\nWatch out for mole crickets, grubs and sod web worms in your turf. Mole crickets have just developed their wings and are beginning their fall flights, which means they will be up near the surface tunneling (damaging) your grass. Grubs are near the surface and easy to kill before they become a food source for moles (armadillo) or damage your root system themselves. Sod web worms can eat a huge amount of grass in a short period of time. Look for moths as you walk around your lawn in the evening. These moths will come up from the ground, fly erratically for a few feet, then land, almost like a quail. Treat with Above and Below and you will take care of both of these guys as well as many other insects.\n\nAlways read, follow and understand the product label before applying any products.\n\nBill Lamson-Scribner can be reached during the week at Possum's Landscape and Pest Control Supply.

        "title": "Chappell Roan's thick-skinned 'The Subway' captures a survivalist New York mood",
        "body": "On Chappell Roan's new song \"The Subway,\" she captures New York City's unique hardships with a broken heart. Ryan Lee Clemens hide caption\n\nIf you're someone who calls New York City home -- someone who is unfazed by rats, cockroaches and bad landlords (know your rights!), who would trade any Casper mattress ad for Dr. Zizmor's rainbow, who would never wait in line for anything you saw an influencer rave about on TikTok -- then the wide-eyed way so many visiting pop stars sing about the city always lands far too cute.\n\nTo the Taylor Swifts of the world, New York City is the beckoning playground of bright lights and big dreams most mainstream rom-coms make it out to be, a sense of promise and romance lurking around every Village or Williamsburg (it's always one of those neighborhoods, sorry) corner. \"Feel so free, feel so free\" the Los Angeles native pop star Addison Rae sang on this year's \"New York,\" hopping from club to club after dropping her bags off at the name-checked Bowery Hotel. On Lorde's recent album Virgin, she sang of dancing in the glow of venues like Baby's All Right and the \"voices of the ancients\" calling out for her in the city streets.\n\nOf course New York City is easy to romanticize. But the longer you're here, the better chance you have of that playground becoming an emotional minefield. New York City, for all its freedom, also requires a sense of stoicism and even coldness from its inhabitants -- this is a city where you can cry openly on the subway without some well-meaning but incorrect stranger trying to console you. That's a reality Chappell Roan gets on her latest break-up song \"The Subway,\" a song she first debuted live at New York's Governor's Ball Festival nearly a year ago, about spotting her ex on the train and almost having \"a breakdown.\" \"It's not over 'til I don't look for you on the staircase, or wish you thought that we were still soulmates,\" she sings. \"But I'm still counting down all of the days, 'til you're just another girl on the subway.\"\n\nIt's a far cry from the last time she released a song about the city, 2023's \"Naked In Manhattan\" from The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess. There, in a pulsing, '80s synth-pop number that has become Roan's specialty, the city was the stage for the singer's sexual experimentation, and Manhattan's allure a metaphor for being with another woman. \"It's similar to the way that New York City makes me feel,\" Roan said in an interview about the earlier song. \"Which is like, excited and kind of like, wanderlust, and it's the same as a girl.\" \"In New York, you can try things,\" Roan sings on that song, capturing the city's seemingly endless array of pleasures and possibilities for her taking.\n\n\"The Subway,\" released during one of the worst weeks in recent memory for NYC's public transportation, instead finds Chappell Roan confronted not with the city's pleasures but its unique severity, which is played up for comedy in the song's accompanying music video. Rats crawl in the singer's hilariously long red curls, which later get stuck in a taxi cab door and drag her through the street. In one scene, she floats in Washington Square Park's fountain like Millais' Ophelia while a young couple makes out a few feet away. Partying drag queens and tired commuters pay her no mind while she's wallowing in the middle of a subway car. Whether in love or heartbroken, Roan still finds the drama and romance in the city's chaos.\n\nBut \"The Subway\" doesn't play like the high-camp, theatrical pop bangers Roan's been cranking out since becoming a household name in the last few years, pulling instead from the '90s jangle-pop acts like The Sundays and The Cranberries, letting her vocals wail at the song's end not unlike the latter's late lead singer Dolores O'Riordan. But don't worry, \"The Subway\" still retains Roan's saltier impulses. \"I made a promise, if in four months this feeling ain't gone,\" she sings. \"Well, f*** this city, I'm movin' to Saskatchewan.\" In a city this big, having to see your ex on the subway and pretend they're just a stranger? Sounds like New York to me.",

        "title": "Budget meal: Rice bowls are quick on prep, easy on the wallet",
        "body": "Rice bowls topped with tasty slivers of beef, chicken, egg, tempura or seafood have ancient roots in Japan and other parts of Asia. But the hearty, one-bowl dishes are also incredibly popular on American tables, given their wide variety and ease of preparation.\n\nThese days, it's just as easy to find a smoothie-like acai bowl made with fresh fruit and granola when you're out to eat as it is a poke bowl comprised of raw fish, rice and other toppings. Ditto with a grain bowl that pairs a protein with fresh veggies for a complete meal.\n\nWhen it comes to a making a dinner everyone will cheer, being able to customize ingredients is a big selling point, not just for flavor and texture but also dietary preferences and allergies. If you can't eat a certain food or just don't like it, there's usually a suitable substitute.\n\nBowls also are popular because they make it easy save a buck. Affordable, everyday staples like carrots, peppers and onions are often common ingredients. And because the meat or protein is chopped or sliced into bite-sized pieces, you can stretch what normally might feed one or two into something that satisfies three or four.\n\nThe same can be said for the sauces that ties everything together. Something as simple as soy sauce mixed with sugar and ginger can add lots of flavor for just pennies.\n\nThis budget menu for two makes the most of pork chops I got on sale, and a bag of one of my favorite (and easiest) appetizers of all time -- shishito peppers.\n\nIf I don't have a list firmly in hand when I head to the grocery store, I usually have at least a fairly good idea of what I want to cook that day or week. But it also benefits home cooks to be flexible about the menu when they happen upon an ingredient that's priced just right.\n\nThis week, it was a 1-pound package of five boneless pork chops for $4.54 and a $1.19 can of pineapple. Along with some fresh veggies, they laid the groundwork for a nutritious and lower-cal rice bowl that took only about 20 minutes from start to finish in a hot pan and a rice cooker.\n\nThe shishitos, which you can sometimes find at farmers markets in summer and also in larger grocery stores, took even less time to prepare -- around 8 minutes, or until they blister in spots when fried in a little oil.\n\nAt $3.99 for an 8-ounce bag, the peppers were definitely a splurge compared with the two rice bowls, which totaled just $6.83 (a mere $3.42 per serving). But they are so tasty, seasonal and easy to whip up I couldn't resist. Besides, haven't we all had our fill of salad as a starter?\n\nBrownies won't start any trends when it comes to dessert, but when baked in a skillet, they're a bit more fun. In the past, I've enhanced brownies with chili powder and nuts; for this batch, I added white chocolate chips for a spot of color. But you won't go wrong with milk or dark chocolate chips or baking them naked without add-ins.\n\nI built the bowls with inexpensive white rice to stay on a $15 budget, but if you're willing to spend a bit more they also can be made with any other favorite grain, including quinoa, brown rice, farro or even wheat berries.\n\nAs always in this on-going series, the final tally excludes ingredients I had on hand and you probably do, too -- soy sauce, carrots, cooking oil, white sugar and vanilla. The most exciting purchase this week was eggs -- just $2.99 a dozen at my local store, about half of what I was paying just a few months ago.\n\nAll told, I came out more than $2 under budget and even had leftovers.\n\nPG tested\n\nNative to Japan, but incredibly popular on American menus, shishito peppers are almost always eaten while they are bright green. (They turn red as they ripen.) They are hotter then bell peppers, but fall below jalapeños on the Scoville scale. But be forewarned: one in 10 packs some serious heat.\n\nHere, the wrinkled peppers are quickly cooked in a hot pan or on a grill until they char and blister. All that's really needed to make them pop on the plate is a sprinkle of flaky salt. You also could go \"fancy\" and garnish them with a little citrus zest, some smoked paprika or a sprinkle of sumac, a tangy Mediterranean spice made from pulverized dried sumac berries.\n\nHeat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, just until it begins to smoke, about 3 minutes\n\nAdd peppers to pan and cook, without stirring, until skins are blistered, 3-5 minutes. Oil will pop, so you could use a lid on the skillet and leave it slightly ajar to avoid spatters.\n\nUse tongs to flip the peppers. Continue cooking over medium-high heat until blistered on the other side, 3-5 minutes.\n\nTransfer peppers to a serving dish and season generously with flaked salt. Let cool a minute or two before serving.\n\nWhether you plan on eating your rice bowl with a spoon, fork or chopsticks, everything on top of the rice should be cut into bite-sized pieces. I used bell peppers and broccoli, but any favorite veggie that's in season works. Leave out the chilies if you want to tame the heat or add more if you prefer spicier dishes. Brown rice is always a more nutritious choice than white, but you gotta choose your battles, right?\n\n1/2 pound boneless pork chops, cut into bite-sized chunks (around 3 pork chops)\n\n1/2 medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped\n\n1 serrano or jalapeno chile, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced\n\n1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks\n\nIn medium bowl, combine pork, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1/2 tablespoon sugar and the cornstarch, and toss until pork is evenly coated.\n\nAdd oil to a skillet and heat over medium-heat until shimmering.\n\nAdd pork in an even layer and cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is lightly browned, 4-5 minutes.\n\nAdd bell pepper, broccoli and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are lightly browned and fork tender, 4-5 minutes.\n\nAdd pineapple, chilies and ginger, then cook, stirring occasionally, until pineapple begins to brown, about 2 minutes.\n\nStir in vinegar, remaining tablespoon soy sauce and another pinch or two of sugar. Cook, stirring often, until meat and vegetables are lightly coated with the sauce, 1-2 minutes.\n\nRemove from heat, taste and season with more soy sauce and vinegar as needed.\n\nSpoon cooked rice into two bowls. Divide pork mixture on top of rice, and sprinkle with the scallions, if desired.\n\nServes 2.\n\n-- adapted from \"Milk Street: 365\" by Christopher Kimball\n\nPG tested\n\nIf you like, these easy dessert brownies can be mixed and baked in the same pan, reducing cleanup. For even more chocolate flavor, add chocolate chips. You could also stir in some coffee granules to intensify the richness. They are on the crumbly side, so if you can wait (we know -- it's hard!) allow them to cool completely in the pan before cutting into wedges.\n\nMelt butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Scrape butter into a bowl with a spatula and set skillet aside,\n\nIn medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.\n\nAdd brown sugar and oil to bowl and stir until well combined.\n\nAdd egg and vanilla and whisk until smooth.\n\nAdd flour mixture to butter mixture and stir until just combined and no flour is visible. Add chocolate or white chocolate chips and stir until evenly distributed.\n\nScrape dough into the empty cast-iron skillet. Spread and push dough into an even layer covering the bottom of the skillet.\n\nTransfer skillet to oven and bake until edges of cookie are set and top looks dry and shiny 16-18 minutes.\n\nRemove skillet to a cooling rack, and let cool for 30 minutes.\n\nUse a butter knife to cut cookie into wedges, being careful not to scratch surface of skillet. Serve.\n\nServes 6-8.\n\n-- adapted form \"The Complete Cook Book for Teen Chefs\" by America's Test Kitchen\n\n©2025 PG Publishing Co. Visit at post-gazette.com.

After a big post-NFP rally, the following Monday is always a bit of a barometer as to the market's level of comfort in the newfound range. In that sense, we're learning one--possibly two things this morning. On a positive note, the ground holding in bonds tells us there are no major regrets.

        "body": "The latest big screen adaptation of the famed superhero comic was directed by James Gunn and stars David Corenswet as the titular superhero, Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. The film has received positive reviews and has already grossed hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nCain previously suggested on a panel with Piers Morgan that the new film shouldn't be made \"woke and crazy.\" He revealed to Variety that he was disappointed to hear about the film's veiled criticisms toward red-state America via the characters of Ma and Pa Kent and disapproved of the \"recurring plot theme that Superman needs to be rescued.\"\n\n\"James Gunn and his decision to make Ma and Pa Kent the stupid rednecks. That's a choice. And Superman has to be saved, like, repeatedly?\"\n\n\"On a movie this size, every decision is a choice made carefully. And [DC Studios co-head] Peter Safran is a Princeton guy, too, a year ahead of me, but he's never hired me.\"\n\nAnd speaking of Trump, whom Cain met after Cain judged a Miss Universe pageant in 2009, he said:\n\n\"I love President Trump. I've been friends with him forever. Trump is actually one of the most empathetic, wonderful, generous people you'll ever meet.\"\n\nThose sure are strong words for a man who in recent weeks has made moves to prosecute his political opponents, has torn families apart amid an ongoing nationwide immigration crackdown, and refuses to release the Epstein files, said to contain detailed lists of some of the late financier, pedophile, and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's most high-profile clients and enablers.\n\nMany have criticized Cain for his remarks, noting they say a lot about his own principles.\n\nCain's words come just weeks after James Gunn, the aforementioned director of the latest Superman film, said that the story of Superman is \"the story of America\" -- a tale that is more relevant than ever considering the ongoing political turmoil in the United States.\n\nGunn, who hopes the film will help people be \"kinder\" to each other, said the film \"does seem to come at a particular time when people are feeling a loss of hope in other people's goodness.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the supposedly \"empathetic\" Trump was criticized last month after the White House posted an AI-generated movie poster featuring Trump as the Man of Steel. Critics pointed out the absurdity of the image because for decades Superman has served as an allegorical avatar for the virtues of immigration.",

        "title": "Donald Trump Snaps at Black Reporter as She Asks About Epstein 'Taking Young Women' From His Mar-a-Lago Resort",
        "body": "President Donald Trump (@Maga_Trigger|X) and late Jeffrey Epstein(@jimstewartson|X).\n\nDonald Trump might be a wise man who's made his way through public scrutiny, legal lawsuits, massive hate from the opposition party, and a strong desire to make America Great Again, despite the negative political tension. This time, he sharply dismissed a reporter's question and made controversial remarks about one of Jeffrey Epstein's most prominent accusers, Virginia Giuffre.\n\nEpstein, the late controversial figure, was a convicted s-x offender who was accused by several underage girls of sexual abuse, leading to a controversial plea deal in 2008 that let him avoid serious federal charges in exchange for shorter jail time. He died under mysterious circumstances in jail in 2019, and his death was ruled a suicide. Still, rumours suggest that he had a client list with names of high-profile individuals, secret information, and much more.\n\nAs per The Atlanta Black Star, the public pressure on Donald Trump continues to sustain despite the administration claiming that no such files exist. Reportedly, even MAGA supporters are upset and have accused the president of denying transparency and not keeping his word. Over the past several weeks, questions about his relationship with Epstein and knowledge of the disgraced financier's crimes have dominated nearly every public appearance.\n\nDuring a July 22 meeting at the White House with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., ABC News reporter Rachel Scott asked Trump whether he was aware of Epstein \"taking young women\" from his Mar-a-Lago resort -- including Giuffre, who had been employed there.\n\nKnowing Trump's peculiar media tactics, he cut her off and said, \"No, I didn't know. I figured it would be ABC fake news that would ask that question -- one of the worst,\" he said. \"But no, I don't know why. I said if he's taken anybody from Mar-a-Lago, he's hiring or whatever he's doing -- I didn't like it. And we threw him out.\"\n\nA day earlier, Donald Trump had suggested Giuffre may have been working at Mar-a-Lago's spa and that Epstein had \"stolen\" her from the resort: \"He stole her. And by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know, none whatsoever.\"\n\nVirginia Giuffre had not only accused Jeffrey Epstein of abuse but also Prince Andrew. She died by suicide in Neergabby, Australia, where she had been living for several years. As per NBC News, Virginia was raised in Florida, where she already had an ugly history of trauma and abuse before she met Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime associate of Epstein, who then moulded her to be abused by the late trafficker from 1999 to 2002.\n\nAs Ghislaine Maxwell, the socialite, was also found guilty on five counts of s-x trafficking in 2021, focus on the Trump administration demanding answers for the release of the secret files continues. Meanwhile, a recent report by Bloomberg revealed that Trump's name was among those high-profile names from the final set of FBI documents related to Epstein.\n\nDeceased Virginia Giuffre's heartbroken family has also issued a public statement where they have firmly stated that they are awaiting justice for their beloved family member, who is no more, due to the heinous deeds of some evil people. \"We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,\" the family's statement added.\n\nAs public pressure increases immensely, will Trump release the files? Or to be more specific, why do the lines between the actual incident and the recent claims by the members of the Trump administration seem so blurred? Is this another political game, or is there more to what the tabloid headlines say?",

How likely is it to actually happen?\n\nSo, you're right, the defense unit is their workers are striking about 3,200 workers or so, uh, as compared to the, you know, 50,000 or so that they're working in the commercial unit, right? So, uh, they make the F-15 fighter jet, they're supposed to make the new upcoming next generation fighter, which is a big deal that Boeing won a contract for. Um, the defense business is profitable, um, which is more than you can say about the commercial business unit right now, but it's much smaller in terms of revenue. Boeing made about 22.6 billion last quarter, uh, but 6.6 of that was with the defense business. So it's a, you know, it's a nice chunk, but it's not the lion's share there. Uh, CEO Kelly Ortberg said during their earnings call that he said did not to worry about this strike, it was coming, they perhaps expected it, and he said it wouldn't have a significant impact on their business, uh, and that they probably see a resolution coming in the next month or so, but we'll see, you never know these things can extend. The last, apparently, the last strike for Boeing's defense workers was, I think, around 90 days, uh, um, maybe like 30 years ago. So, uh, it's a little rare.\n\nAnd the shares are not that much changed today, so it sounds like investors are, you know, they are reassured by what Ortberg has said. All right, thanks, Pras. Appreciate it.",

        "title": "Tesla's Brand Loyalty Plummets, Proving Leftists Are the Overwhelming Market for EVs",
        "body": "Tesla, once the automotive industry leader in customer loyalty, has seen its brand loyalty collapse after CEO Elon Musk publicly expressed conservative political values, according to exclusive data from research firm S&P Global Mobility.\n\nReuters reports that Elon Musk's has long enjoyed the highest repeat customer rate in the automotive industry. However, new data from S&P Global Mobility reveals that the company's brand loyalty has plummeted since CEO Elon Musk endorsed President Donald Trump in July 2024. Musk's betrayal of Trump has done little to bring its leftist customer base back to the company.\n\nThe data, based on an analysis of vehicle registration information from all 50 states, shows that Tesla's customer loyalty peaked in June 2024 at an impressive 73 percent. This meant that nearly three-quarters of Tesla-owning households in the market for a new car opted to purchase another Tesla.\n\nHowever, immediately following Musk's endorsement of Trump in July 2024, Tesla's loyalty rate began to nosedive. It bottomed out at just 49.9 percent in March 2025, falling below the industry average, after Musk started working with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and began laying off thousands of federal workers.\n\nWhile Tesla's U.S. loyalty rate has since rebounded slightly to 57.4 percent as of May 2025, it remains well below the company's previous industry-leading position. Tesla now trails domestic automakers like Chevrolet and Ford in customer loyalty, though it remains slightly ahead of Toyota.\n\nAnalysts point to Musk's increasing political activism as a key factor in turning off many customers in Tesla's eco-conscious base. \"If they have Democratic leanings, then perhaps they consider other brands in addition to Tesla,\" noted Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar.\n\nBreitbart News recently reported on a study that shows leftists aren't just turned off from buying Teslas -- they're turning away from EVs in general:\n\nLeftists are now far less likely to purchase Tesla EVs due to growing disgust with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's recent rightward political turn, according to a new study published in the journal Nature. Although that tracks with Tesla dismal sales in the last quarter, the second finding of the study was quite surprising. Fanatical leftists are not turning to Tesla's competitors, they're simply buying less electric vehicles.\n\nThe research, conducted by psychologist Alexandra Flores from Williams College, found that while leftists had mostly positive intentions around buying electric vehicles as recently as August 2023, their support eroded significantly in the wake of Musk's alliance with President Donald Trump. Musk helped propel Trump to victory in the 2024 election and later served as his top adviser.\n\nTesla is also facing heightened competition from a growing array of electric vehicles from established automakers like General Motors, Hyundai, and BMW. The company's aging model lineup and the disappointing reception for its Cybertruck have further contributed to its challenges.\n\nThe decline in brand loyalty has coincided with an eight percent drop in Tesla's U.S. vehicle sales in the first five months of 2025. In Europe, where public backlash against Musk's political involvement has been especially strong, Tesla's sales plummeted 33 percent in the first half of the year.\n\nRead more at Reuters here.",

Our web team here at ICE ... is outstanding. And we have the leadership of Tricia McLaughlin, who's ... the Secretary for Public Affairs and press secretary for Secretary Noem.

They're not out there highlighting the great work, the bad actors we get every day, known suspected terrorists .... gang members, crushing these foreign terrorist organizations, these FTOs the president designated under Executive Order,\" Lyons explained.\n\nInstead, Lyons said the leftist media tries to \"pull at the heartstrings and show that ICE is bad\" and portray the men and women of ICE as \"wrong\" in what they are doing.\n\n\"So the outstanding comm teams and the social media teams that we have are amazing because, like you said, within minutes, we're debunking those stories,\" he said. \"But if people are active on social media like they are nowadays, you're going to see exactly what the men and women of ICE do every day. They're going to profile those heinous actors that we're encountering daily, and that's what we hope the American people see.\"\n\n\"This what they voted for,\" he added. \"So we're going to make sure that they understand exactly what ICE is doing every day.\"\n\nLISTEN:",

Maybe even something alien. (Cue the eerie music.)\n\nThere have been 2,557 UFO sightings reported to the NUFORC in 2025 (as of August), with January having the most with over 500.\n\nIt's probably not a surprise that most of the reports come from the United States, as the UFO report center is based in Washington.\n\nWhen it comes to Maine, the state ranks at No. 36 for the most total NUFORC reports. The No. 1 spot would be California, if you're wondering.\n\nMaybe some celebs are aliens... Time to call the Men in Black, right?\n\nIf we take a look at how many UFO sightings there have been in 2025, the UFO center has had eight reports in Maine since January 1, 2025.\n\nThe places these 2025 sightings have reportedly occurred are Gorham, Augusta, South Portland, Sabattus, Tremont, and Leeds.\n\nREAD MORE: There Were 30 UFO Sightings in Maine in 2024\n\nThe sightings include bright orbs in the sky, a descending sphere, and even a silent black \"something\" that looked sort of like a TV screen.\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nWhat else will 2025 bring? There are likely to be some more reported sightings as the year goes on, and some that people don't report either.\n\nREAD MORE: These Are the 9 Maine Counties Where Bigfoot Has Been Spotted\n\nYou might be surprised to know that New England had one of the first UFO sightings, too.\n\nAccording to NewEngland.com, it took place in 1639 in Boston: \"The first documented UFO sighting in America occurred here, as did the first widely publicized claim of alien abduction.\"\n\nSeems like Maine is something of a hot spot for UFOs, right?\n\nDo you believe in aliens?

        "title": "Cape Cod-Based Painter Derek Macara Pulls Inspiration from the Sea - COOL HUNTING®",
        "body": "Soothing seascapes and dreamy cloud formations evoke peace and solitude while showcasing the area's natural beauty\n\nDerek Macara, an artist from the Provincetown area of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, has been surrounded by the sea his whole life. He's been painting since childhood but in the past 10 years or so, what was once a just-for-fun hobby has evolved into a full-fledged art career.\n\nHis oil paintings typically portray coastal elements that are nearly impossible to avoid on the Cape -- think ocean views, lighthouses, boats and gloriously unique, moody clouds. This work is about more than just the beach, though. The viewer can get lost in these mesmerizing seascapes and the realistic nature of Macara's paintings instantly evoke a sense of calm and wonder for what might happen next in the depicted scene.\n\nProvincetown -- sometimes called P-Town by locals and tourists alike -- is a wildly popular vacation destination during the summer months, but most of the time it's actually a small, close-knit art colony. Because of his surroundings, Macara was exposed to many artists while honing his own skills and as a child, he studied at Charles W. Hawthorne's art school (now an arts non-profit called Twenty Summers) for several years.\n\n\"My first art show was in a pizza place in Provincetown that I didn't expect much from,\" Macara says, \"but [it] ended up being a sold out show. When I was first starting out there were so many supportive people in the community that believed in me and I owe [them] a lot of my success today because I'm lucky enough to live here.\"\n\nBesides growing up in such a supportive, creative enclave, a major key to his global recognition -- Macara has shipped sold paintings to every continent aside from Antarctica -- is his TikTok presence. Drawing on his past skateboard video experience, video editing comes easily to him and he views it as another creative outlet. \"I started filming my process and posting on TikTok about two years ago and it really took off in the first year,\" he says. \"Video editing is also an art and I try to put as much effort into that as I do my paintings.\"\n\nHis videos typically start with a blank canvas being placed on his easel, and over the next minute or so, it shows his seemingly magical process of building up colors, blending waves and clouds, and adding that perfect Cape Cod detail with a variety of brushes. Whether it's a lighthouse, a fisherman or a sailboat at sea, his Provincetown influence shines through in the best way possible. We were captivated by this glimpse into how he creates his work, as are the millions of viewers who've also absorbed his artistic videos.\n\nOf course, the creative process isn't as simple as it might appear online. To nail down the painting's composition, Macara uses his own nature photography and drawings to compile real-life nature details into a digital image. \"My paintings are usually a combination of modern technology and traditional painting techniques,\" he says. \"I create a composite image before I begin painting as a reference to go off of on the canvas. This usually evolves into something different during the painting process and I'll improvise from imagination in areas.\"\n\nFor Macara, whose family has lived in Provincetown for several generations, inspiration is readily available and he's able to paint almost everyday. \"It's a really beautiful place to live,\" he says about his hometown, \"and the natural beauty along with the solitude of it can be seen in my work.\"",

        "title": "Pro Panja League 2: 'Bicep King' Sachin Goyal excited to put on a show for home crowd in Guwahati",
        "body": "Gwalior, Aug 4 (SocialNews.XYZ) Sachin Goyal, a professional arm-wrestler for Pro Panja League side MP Hathodas, affectionately known as the 'Bicep King' by his two-million plus strong fanbase on social media is all set to flex his strength in front of fans in his home city of Gwalior with the second edition of the tournament set to kick-off on Tuesday.\n\nPPL Season 2 has chosen the scenic Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, as the host city for its highly anticipated upcoming season. Following the success of Season 1, this decision is consistent with the league's strategy to boost and expand sports appeal across the Indian Map and to make the tournament accessible in iconic Indian destinations, significantly boosting event partnership and sporting talent participation. The decision to host Season 2 in Gwalior was likely influenced by the venue's previous experience hosting the Pro Panja Ranking Tournament in 2022.\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with IANS, Goyal reflected on getting the chance to show his skills in front of his home crowd and how the PPL has revolutionised the sport.\n\n\"It feels really exciting. This is not the first tournament that we have had here in Gwalior. Last time I had reached the finals and the fans came in numbers and chanted 'Bicep King', my nickname.\n\n\"I used to play Panja since I was nine years old, but it was not until the Pro Panja League that it gained popularity. It is the biggest and best league in the world in this sport,\" Goyal told IANS.\n\nSix teams, including Mumbai Muscle, Jaipur Veers, Kiraak Hyderabad, Sher-e-Ludhiana, Rohtak Rowdies, and MP Hathodas, will vie for the coveted title as the league grows in scale, strength, and inclusivity.\n\n\"We have a very solid team, the players are strong, and I hope it is going to be a great tournament,\" he added.\n\nThe tournament's format includes a set number of pins (winning the round), which must be earned by the winner of a match in the Pro Panja League, which is based on a series of bouts between two players. For both male and female competitors, matches are held within predetermined weight categories. There are also extra categories for people with physical disabilities. During a season, several teams compete against one another in a league format, which ends with a final playoff.\n\nThe Pro Panja League India's professional arm wrestling league is expected to enthral viewers with its thrilling atmosphere and spirit of competition in its upcoming Season 2. Through streaming collaborations with well-known platforms like Sony Sports 3, DD Sports, FanCode, and SportVot (for outside of India), this season seeks to increase the league's visibility and influence.",

        "title": "Budget meal: Rice bowls are quick on prep, easy on the wallet",
        "body": "Rice bowls topped with tasty slivers of beef, chicken, egg, tempura or seafood have ancient roots in Japan and other parts of Asia. But the hearty, one-bowl dishes are also incredibly popular on American tables, given their wide variety and ease of preparation.\n\nThese days, it's just as easy to find a smoothie-like acai bowl made with fresh fruit and granola when you're out to eat as it is a poke bowl comprised of raw fish, rice and other toppings. Ditto with a grain bowl that pairs a protein with fresh veggies for a complete meal.\n\nWhen it comes to a making a dinner everyone will cheer, being able to customize ingredients is a big selling point, not just for flavor and texture but also dietary preferences and allergies. If you can't eat a certain food or just don't like it, there's usually a suitable substitute.\n\nBowls also are popular because they make it easy save a buck. Affordable, everyday staples like carrots, peppers and onions are often common ingredients. And because the meat or protein is chopped or sliced into bite-sized pieces, you can stretch what normally might feed one or two into something that satisfies three or four.\n\nThe same can be said for the sauces that ties everything together. Something as simple as soy sauce mixed with sugar and ginger can add lots of flavor for just pennies.\n\nThis budget menu for two makes the most of pork chops I got on sale, and a bag of one of my favorite (and easiest) appetizers of all time -- shishito peppers.\n\nIf I don't have a list firmly in hand when I head to the grocery store, I usually have at least a fairly good idea of what I want to cook that day or week. But it also benefits home cooks to be flexible about the menu when they happen upon an ingredient that's priced just right.\n\nThis week, it was a 1-pound package of five boneless pork chops for $4.54 and a $1.19 can of pineapple. Along with some fresh veggies, they laid the groundwork for a nutritious and lower-cal rice bowl that took only about 20 minutes from start to finish in a hot pan and a rice cooker.\n\nThe shishitos, which you can sometimes find at farmers markets in summer and also in larger grocery stores, took even less time to prepare -- around 8 minutes, or until they blister in spots when fried in a little oil.\n\nAt $3.99 for an 8-ounce bag, the peppers were definitely a splurge compared with the two rice bowls, which totaled just $6.83 (a mere $3.42 per serving). But they are so tasty, seasonal and easy to whip up I couldn't resist. Besides, haven't we all had our fill of salad as a starter?\n\nBrownies won't start any trends when it comes to dessert, but when baked in a skillet, they're a bit more fun. In the past, I've enhanced brownies with chili powder and nuts; for this batch, I added white chocolate chips for a spot of color. But you won't go wrong with milk or dark chocolate chips or baking them naked without add-ins.\n\nI built the bowls with inexpensive white rice to stay on a $15 budget, but if you're willing to spend a bit more they also can be made with any other favorite grain, including quinoa, brown rice, farro or even wheat berries.\n\nAs always in this on-going series, the final tally excludes ingredients I had on hand and you probably do, too -- soy sauce, carrots, cooking oil, white sugar and vanilla. The most exciting purchase this week was eggs -- just $2.99 a dozen at my local store, about half of what I was paying just a few months ago.\n\nAll told, I came out more than $2 under budget and even had leftovers.\n\nPG tested\n\nNative to Japan, but incredibly popular on American menus, shishito peppers are almost always eaten while they are bright green. (They turn red as they ripen.) They are hotter then bell peppers, but fall below jalapeños on the Scoville scale. But be forewarned: one in 10 packs some serious heat.\n\nHere, the wrinkled peppers are quickly cooked in a hot pan or on a grill until they char and blister. All that's really needed to make them pop on the plate is a sprinkle of flaky salt. You also could go \"fancy\" and garnish them with a little citrus zest, some smoked paprika or a sprinkle of sumac, a tangy Mediterranean spice made from pulverized dried sumac berries.\n\nHeat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, just until it begins to smoke, about 3 minutes\n\nAdd peppers to pan and cook, without stirring, until skins are blistered, 3-5 minutes. Oil will pop, so you could use a lid on the skillet and leave it slightly ajar to avoid spatters.\n\nUse tongs to flip the peppers. Continue cooking over medium-high heat until blistered on the other side, 3-5 minutes.\n\nTransfer peppers to a serving dish and season generously with flaked salt. Let cool a minute or two before serving.\n\nWhether you plan on eating your rice bowl with a spoon, fork or chopsticks, everything on top of the rice should be cut into bite-sized pieces. I used bell peppers and broccoli, but any favorite veggie that's in season works. Leave out the chilies if you want to tame the heat or add more if you prefer spicier dishes. Brown rice is always a more nutritious choice than white, but you gotta choose your battles, right?\n\n1/2 pound boneless pork chops, cut into bite-sized chunks (around 3 pork chops)\n\n1/2 medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped\n\n1 serrano or jalapeno chile, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced\n\n1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks\n\nIn medium bowl, combine pork, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1/2 tablespoon sugar and the cornstarch, and toss until pork is evenly coated.\n\nAdd oil to a skillet and heat over medium-heat until shimmering.\n\nAdd pork in an even layer and cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is lightly browned, 4-5 minutes.\n\nAdd bell pepper, broccoli and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are lightly browned and fork tender, 4-5 minutes.\n\nAdd pineapple, chilies and ginger, then cook, stirring occasionally, until pineapple begins to brown, about 2 minutes.\n\nStir in vinegar, remaining tablespoon soy sauce and another pinch or two of sugar. Cook, stirring often, until meat and vegetables are lightly coated with the sauce, 1-2 minutes.\n\nRemove from heat, taste and season with more soy sauce and vinegar as needed.\n\nSpoon cooked rice into two bowls. Divide pork mixture on top of rice, and sprinkle with the scallions, if desired.\n\nServes 2.\n\n-- adapted from \"Milk Street: 365\" by Christopher Kimball\n\nPG tested\n\nIf you like, these easy dessert brownies can be mixed and baked in the same pan, reducing cleanup. For even more chocolate flavor, add chocolate chips. You could also stir in some coffee granules to intensify the richness. They are on the crumbly side, so if you can wait (we know -- it's hard!) allow them to cool completely in the pan before cutting into wedges.\n\nMelt butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Scrape butter into a bowl with a spatula and set skillet aside,\n\nIn medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.\n\nAdd brown sugar and oil to bowl and stir until well combined.\n\nAdd egg and vanilla and whisk until smooth.\n\nAdd flour mixture to butter mixture and stir until just combined and no flour is visible. Add chocolate or white chocolate chips and stir until evenly distributed.\n\nScrape dough into the empty cast-iron skillet. Spread and push dough into an even layer covering the bottom of the skillet.\n\nTransfer skillet to oven and bake until edges of cookie are set and top looks dry and shiny 16-18 minutes.\n\nRemove skillet to a cooling rack, and let cool for 30 minutes.\n\nUse a butter knife to cut cookie into wedges, being careful not to scratch surface of skillet. Serve.\n\nServes 6-8.\n\n-- adapted form \"The Complete Cook Book for Teen Chefs\" by America's Test Kitchen\n\n©2025 PG Publishing Co. Visit at post-gazette.com.

        "title": "Should A Hallmark Kiss Include A Little Tongue? We Asked A Bunch Of Stars",
        "body": "A good Hallmark Rom-Com needs that moment where the couple finally gets together. It needs a payoff for riding the will-they-or-won't-they highs and lows. It needs the lead couple to finally give us the kiss we've been waiting for. But what should that kiss look like? Or taste like? Should there be a little bit of tongue?\n\nWe were recently at San Diego Comic-Con and got a chance to meet with a lot of Hallmark's regular players to talk about their upcoming movies and TV shows. More importantly, we also gave them a chance to settle the debate. When it comes to the big movie kiss, should the actors give us a little bit of tongue? You can check out the answers from Chyler Leigh, Holland Roden, Erin Cahil and more Hallmark favorites...\n\nTo paraphrase Tyler Hynes, who you may also recognize from Letterkenny, the right kiss is whatever both of the co-stars are comfortable with. It definitely isn't slobbering all over each other like high school kids in the backseat of a car, but it also isn't a quick peck on the lips. You need to let the audience see the passion and the release of all that sexual tension, but you don't need to feel like they're about to start taking off layers of clothing. As Christine Taylor put it in The Wedding Singer, you're looking for church tongue.\n\nOne of the things I love most about Hallmark is how often you see the same faces. The network does a good job of bringing in just enough new talent, but in general, you really get to know the same few dozen actors who work on several movies or TV series each year. Because of that, it was fun for us here at CinemaBlend to speculate on who might be down for a little tongue and who might not want to go there.\n\nRegardless of whether they're okay with opening their mouths during their on-screen kisses or not, you'll be able to see everyone in the video back for some upcoming movies in the near future. We're still a few months away from the much-loved holiday movie season starting, but that's no longer a problem for fans. Hallmark's upcoming movie schedule now includes at least one premiere every weekend, sometimes two.\n\nMost are of the standard romance variety, but the network has also diversified with more mystery series. Those usually include at least some romantic flirting, but sometimes you need to wait multiple movies to finally get that kiss. Fortunately, that means it's all the more satisfying when it finally does happen. Besides, waiting a few movies is nothing like the wait we've gotten on some classic network TV procedurals in the past.",

        "title": "Dozens killed as Palestinians in Gaza scramble for aid from air and land",
        "body": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Dozens of Palestinians were killed or wounded on Monday as desperate crowds headed toward food distribution points and airdropped parcels in the Gaza Strip, according to witnesses and local health officials.\n\nIsrael's blockade and military offensive have made it nearly impossible to safely deliver aid, contributing to the territory's slide toward famine nearly 22 months into the war with Hamas. Aid groups say Israel's week-old measures to allow more aid in are far from sufficient. Families of hostages in Gaza fear starvation affects them too, but blame Hamas.\n\nHamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nSeveral hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since May while heading toward food distribution sites and aid convoys, according to witnesses, local health officials and the United Nations human rights office. The military says it has only fired warning shots and disputes the toll.\n\nAs international alarm has mounted, several countries have airdropped aid over Gaza. The U.N. and aid groups call such drops costly and dangerous for residents, and say they deliver far less aid than trucks.\n\nMany food parcels dropped by air have splashed into the Mediterranean Sea or landed in so-called red zones from which Israel's military has ordered people to evacuate. In either case, Palestinians risk their lives to get flour and other basic goods.\n\nOn Monday, Palestinians cheered as pallets of aid were parachuted over Zuweida in central Gaza. Associated Press footage showed a desperate scramble when the parcels hit the ground, with hundreds of people racing toward them. Fistfights broke out and some men wielded batons.\n\n\"I wish they would deliver it through the (land) crossings,\" Rabah Rabah said earlier as he waited for the airdrop. \"This is inhuman.\"\n\nAt least one parcel fell on a tent where displaced people had been sheltering, injuring a man who was taken to a hospital. His condition was not immediately known.\n\nAt least 16 people were killed late Sunday near the Israeli-controlled Zikim Crossing, the main entry point for aid to northern Gaza, according to records at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, which showed that more than 130 people were wounded.\n\nThe circumstances were not immediately clear, but the crossing has seen several shootings in recent days that witnesses and health officials blamed on Israeli forces. There was no immediate comment from the military.\n\nAt least 10 people were killed as thousands waited for aid trucks in the Morag Corridor, which the Israeli military carved out between the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.\n\nMohammed al-Masri, who was among the crowds, said Israeli forces opened fire when a group of young men tried to make their way to the front. \"The occupation forces shot many people in the head and in the back,\" he said, adding that he saw four wounded people, one motionless on the ground.\n\nNasser Hospital in Khan Younis said it received 10 bodies from Morag and another five who were killed near an aid site in southern Gaza run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor.\n\nGHF said there were no violent incidents at or near its sites. It said a new U.N. route runs near two of its sites in the south and has drawn large crowds of people who unload the convoys. GHF says its contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots on a few occasions to prevent deadly crowding since it opened four sites in May.\n\nAl-Awda Hospital in central Gaza said it received the bodies of eight people killed near a GHF site in the Israeli-controlled Netzarim Corridor, and that another 50 people were wounded. Witnesses and health officials said Israeli forces had fired toward the crowds.\n\nAn Associated Press photo showed a man carrying a body away from the site, as others hauled bags of food.\n\n\"It's like yesterday, and the day before,\" said Ayman Ruqab, a young Palestinian who said he had tried unsuccessfully to reach the site for the past three days. \"It's a death trap.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said it fired warning shots at people who approached \"in a manner that posed a threat to the troops,\" without elaborating. It said it was not aware of any casualties.\n\nHamas-led terrorists killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. They still hold 50 hostages, around 20 of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military offensive has killed more than 60,900 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says around half the dead have been women and children, is staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and other independent experts view its figures as the most reliable casualty count.\n\nIsrael has disputed the figures but hasn't provided its own.",

        "body": "Previous rumors supposedly discovered the Buds 3 FE's design in a leaked render, which looks closer to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.\n\nSamsung is seemingly moving right along with its second-generation FE earbuds, as the pair surfaces in an important listing.\n\nA post by The Tech Outlook reports discovering the Galaxy Buds 3 FE in an FCC and SGS Fimko certification over the weekend (via SamMobile). The certification appearance for the latter supposedly revealed Samsung's battery and charging upgrades for the device. This year's Galaxy Buds 3 FE were reportedly listed with a massive 900mAh charging case.\n\nAt the same time, the publication reports spotting an upgrade to the buds themselves. The leak claims the buds are listed with a 200mAh battery within each of them.\n\nThe FCC listing is a little more technical, detailing the Galaxy Buds 3 FE's connectivity, which is Bluetooth, as one might expect.\n\nFor context, the upgrades we've seen leaked for the Buds 3 FE seem to blow the original Buds FE out of the water. The original pair, revealed in 2023, granted its buds with a 60mAh battery each, and popped a 479mAh battery in its charging case. Should these listings prove true, consumers might see quite an extension in battery life overall.\n\nRumors about Samsung's second-generation Buds FE have snuck up on us; however, they've begun to allege an upgraded experience. In mid-July, reports supposedly revealed the Galaxy Buds 3 FE design via a render. If true, the buds could look quite similar to Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro with a black silicone tip and the \"Blade Design.\"\n\nIt's also unclear if the Buds 3 FE will support Samsung's \"Blade Lights.\" The base Galaxy Buds 3 do not support this, so there might be a chance that the FE variant skips this, too.\n\nOther details are still in the dark, but there's a chance we're only a month away from a reveal. A report after Unpacked claimed Samsung was gearing up to unveil its Galaxy Tab S11 series \"shortly\" after the event, and that rumor placed the Buds 3 FE right beside it. It seems we're looking at a September launch, though nothing's set in stone just yet. Pricing is also a wonder for this year's Buds FE. We only have the original to look back on from 2023, which debuted at $99.",

        "title": "Is baby getting enough breastmilk? New device helps moms learn",
        "body": "A group of university researchers at Northwestern -- including a nursing mother -- have come up with a way to ease one of the most anxiety-producing dilemmas of early breastfeeding: How much milk is the baby consuming?\n\nThe new device -- the result of a collaboration between pediatricians and engineers -- is a small wireless set of electrodes worn on the mother's breast that measures the amount of milk expressed during a feeding.\n\nAlthough it still in development and is not yet available to the public, Julia Seitchik, who left the hospital with her first child weighing less than 5 pounds, was able to give it a test run with her third child and called it a \"game-changer.\"\n\nShe was committed to breastfeeding her first infant, but there was \"no room for error.\" If her baby lost more than 10% of her body weight, the newborn would have to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n\"You have no idea what they're getting. You have no idea of whether milk's coming out, because especially in the beginning it's not like it's flowing,\" Seitchik said. She hired a lactation consultant, who would weigh the baby before and after a feeding to make sure she was getting enough milk -- a cumbersome process that required she have a tiny scale at home.\n\n\"There was a lot of anxiety around it,\" she said. \"My husband was like, 'We should just formula feed her!'\"\n\nThis is often the moment that breastfeeding gets derailed, said Dr. Jennifer Wicks, an attending physician in the NICU at Lurie Children's Hospital and instructor at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine, who was breastfeeding her own child during the study she was involved with. When she used to work in a pediatric practice, Wicks said, parents would \"come in and just be panicked that their baby isn't getting enough, and that they weren't producing enough milk. It's really just a complete unknown oftentimes.\"\n\nThe anxiety itself can decrease the flow of milk, and many mothers would start pumping and introducing formula at this point, which can further reduce milk production, said Wicks. Ultimately, many simply give up on breastfeeding.\n\nJust 27% of infants in the U.S. breastfeed exclusively through 6 months of age. Healthy People 2030, a Health and Human Services Department initiative that sets national health targets, set a goal of 42%, an acknowledgment that breastfeeding can be challenging and not all women are able to do it for a host of reasons.\n\n\"If we can get moms even a little closer to that goal it will make us feel like we've at least partially been successful in this mission,\" said Wicks.\n\nThe creation of the tiny device began four years ago with a tour of the NICU by a team of engineers from Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering dedicated to solving questions affecting patient care.\n\nThe pediatricians wanted help with a dilemma: Moms wanted to know how much milk their babies were drinking, but there was no way to know. And in the NICU, the sickest babies wouldn't even be able to breastfeed safely unless they could measure the exact amount of milk they were consuming.\n\n\"They asked us if we could cook up a solution that would address that need,\" said John Rogers, who leads the engineering team.\n\nThey got to work.\n\nThe team started by trying to create a device that could be worn by the baby. They tried mounting sensors on the infant's chin and chest to test if the amount of milk a baby drinks could be measured through swallowing, but it didn't work. They tried to measure properties of the stomach of the baby, but it was too hard to isolate the effect of the milk. So they switched to measuring the mother.\n\n\"We went down so many dead ends that we almost gave up,\" said Rogers. Finally, Rogers made a fortuitous visit to his own physician, where he had his BMI checked using a small device that sends electrical signals through the body to measure the amount of fat. Could the same technology be used to measure milk in the breast, he wondered?\n\nAnd so the breastfeeding device was born: a small wireless set of electrodes placed on the breast that measure the change in electrical currents of the breast tissue to determine how much milk is being expressed. The data are transmitted via Bluetooth to a phone, where parents can watch the consumption data appear over the course of a feeding.\n\nResearchers tested the device on 12 pumping and breastfeeding mothers and published the results in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. Rogers said feeding is rarely predictable. Sometimes, it starts slow and then builds. Other times, the baby gets a flood of milk in the beginning, and then slows down as a feeding goes on.\n\n\"Being able to watch it on the phone provides a lot of reassurance and guidance,\" said Rogers, giving the mother information on how long she needs to feed, and whether she might need to reposition the baby.\n\nIt also informed parents and physicians on whether the mother might need to change her breastfeeding routine.\n\n\"There are some moms who produce enough to feed the whole neighborhood but others do not,\" said Dr. Craig Garfield, an attending physician at Lurie Children's Hospital and professor at the Feinberg School of Medicine. \"If you knew a mom wasn't producing enough, you could have her feed first and then pump after to increase her supply.\"\n\nSeitchik, who was part of the trial and used the device at home while pumping milk for her son, praised it.\n\n\"In this data driven world, to just to kind of go blindly into these situations feels like a little funny,\" she said. \"It feels like we should know how much our kids are eating.\"\n\nFor decades, new technology was slow to develop for new mothers and babies in the postpartum period.\n\n\"It's not a large market share opportunity, so there's not a lot of venture capital funding, but also it's a really compelling need,\" said Rogers. \"It's a great space for academics to come in and try to fill that gap.\"\n\nThe private market has been hesitant to invest in postpartum devices \"because it's a very short period of time that these things get used, and sometimes they can be quite expensive,\" said Christina Farr, an investor with Scrub Capital and author of the health tech newsletter Second Opinion. Often, a woman will buy a device like a wearable breast pump and then sell it online or give it to a friend.\n\n\"Then you just lost a customer,\" said Farr.\n\nBut investors are beginning to take note of the opportunities in women's health after a few breakout successes, including Maven, a women's health startup valued at $1.7 billion, and Midi, which is focused on menopause.\n\nThe postpartum period is also ripe for development, said Farr. \"There's so much desperation and need at this moment, and very little that has really changed in the past number of decades to support women.\"\n\nThis article is part of The Times' early childhood education initiative, focusing on the learning and development of California children from birth to age 5.

        "title": "Let's talk about the Sydney Sweeney of it all | The Mary Sue",
        "body": "Sydney Sweeney is always a topic of conversation on the internet whether it be good or bad. Now, people are potentially outing her address because they wanted to prove something about an ad she did. Frankly, enough already.\n\nRumors swirled online after Sweeney's controversial American Eagle ad that she is registered to vote under the Republican party in Florida. Famously, your registration doesn't mean that's what you voted for in an actual election. It only really matters when it comes to primary voting. Besides that, publicly, Sweeney has supported anti-MAGA causes such as women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and more.\n\nNot to defend Sweeney and the ad or her potential voter registration but based on information that she, herself, has presented, we are to believe that she's not on Donald Trump's side. Whether or not that is true isn't really our business right now because she publicly isn't supporting him or encouraging her fanbase to do so.\n\nYou can think what you want about this situation but what I don't really LOVE is that people think it is okay to just go ahead and post her address as a \"gotcha\" when it isn't exactly surprising that Sweeney would, potentially, be registered as a Republican. She did have a party for her mother that had MAGA hats, it was a whole thing.\n\nSo even if she is a Republican who voted for Donald Trump, that's information that we all sort of had. I am more interested in her public persona and if she isn't encouraging people to vote for him/attack everyone's rights as the MAGA party suggests people do, then I'm not as angry about the situation. But what I think is so weird about this whole thing is that people are using this potential truth as a gotcha...\n\nLook, I love when a woman uses her publicly persona to make a buck. Sweeney selling her own \"bath water\" is kind of iconic of her because men will sexualize her no matter what she does. But the obsession has gotten even weirder than the typical men heavy breathing every time her name is brought up. People just want to hate her one way or another and will seek out reasons to do so.\n\nIf she really is registered as a Republican and voted for Trump, that's disappointing but also if that's what she wants to do with her vote then so be it. I won't be buying her soap anyway but a lot of her work is important for the myriad of issues listed above. Like the movie about Christy Martin, a queer boxer who held the WBC female super welterweight title in 2009, that Sweeney is in.\n\nI'd like to point out that men like Robert Downey Jr. have been reportedly, in the past, registered to vote with the Republican party but have joined together to campaign for people like Joe Biden. Your registration doesn't define you and using it as a \"see, knew I didn't like them\" moment just comes across as weird and counter productive!\n\nI will say, Trump coming out on Sweeney's side is something that I do think she needs to address because if she gives the \"Thank you, President Trump\" response, then this is all a different story but for now, let's maybe not out someone's address because of a jeans ad...",

        "title": "Peggy Noonan on Work, Immigration Priorities",
        "body": "Work is still an American ideal, and provides purpose - and community - to those who need it most\n\nOnce again, every Saturday, Wall Street Journal op-ed writer Peggy Noonan, in her \"Declarations\" column, articulated my thoughts better than I often can myself. (By the way, she'd make the top 10 of any presidential candidate list I could currently assemble.)\n\nHer August 2 column was titled \"Stop the ICE Workplace Raids.\" Noonan has long opposed illegal immigration but sees our American spirit contradicted in the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids taking place in farms, construction sites, restaurants and meatpacking plants. I do too.\n\nHer column acknowledges the work President Donald Trump has done in essentially closing the border, and ridding ourselves of the thugs and criminals who came here illegally. But she also implores the administration to stop its targeting of hardworking immigrants and their employers - both of whom are keys to the engines of commerce. And for everyone's collective well-being ...\n\nMy formative years in business reporting were spent in the foundry industry. While I've been firmly planted in ag for 22 years now, I can say, without hesitation, that much of the American foundry industry of the 1990s would've had little chance of survival without the largely immigrant labor who kept those lines moving. I witnessed immigrants doing the jobs that many late 20th-century citizens would no longer take. It wasn't that wages or earning power were poor; no, quite the opposite. It was because it was hot, hard and often required a change of clothes after a shift.\n\nA different, more entitled generation was conditioned to stay home on their couches with their gaming devices, or maybe flip burgers at McDonald's until they grew tired of that, too. Thankfully, those jobs were highly valued by those with lesser advantages in life.\n\nOur nation's history is full of dreams fulfilled through honest, though often hard, work. And we all (businesses and communities) enjoyed the direct benefits of their labor - from the apples picked to the parts produced for our cars and everything in between.\n\nI wish I could share Noonan's entire column with you, but it's worth digging last Saturday's paper out of your recycling bin or logging into WSJ's expansive online library.\n\nShe repeated that Trump is out of step with most Americans' depth of the matter when it comes to those immigrants already contributing to our nation through their work. Trump the businessman should \"get\" this one. Surely he can identify that a nation's true wealth creation comes from 3 activities - mining, farming and manufacturing - all of which are in great need of basic labor to carry them out.\n\nIn her argument for ICE to quit storming workplaces, she also delivered real gems about work that I wanted chronicled where I'd be able to find them again. This is an important subject for me ... As you've seen from other \"TO THE POINT\" columns, I maintain that work is a God-intended gift, and privilege that we get to exercise via a purpose and mission here on this earth.\n\nNoonan noted that Americans are identified with work. \"We respect it, and we have an almost mystical attachment to the idea of it,\" she writes. \"We think 'hard worker' means 'good American.'\"\n\nWhy do we do it, she asks? \"To support ourselves. To belong to something. To build wealth. To be integrated into life, whether we think of it like that or not. To pursue a vocation or be part of an admirable profession. To not be alone.\"\n\nHere is a sampling of just a portion Noonan's fine gems this week, on \"work\" and why it's worthy of all our respect.\n\nThanks, Peggy Noonan, for the reminder...\n\nThe raised torch of Lady Liberty was meant to light the way for those willing to, through sweat and tears, contribute to this new land of ours. That's a distinction worth making today - the contributors ...\n\nNo, we should no longer allow the reckless border sins of the past. The objectors to a controlled border can argue for alternative solutions, including but not limited to opening their homes as sponsor to those they weep for; a model of support that was used responsibility and successfully in previous chapters. I attempted to advance this notion through a blog last December, Immigration: Let Business Take Over.\n\nAnd no, we should not allow raids of clean-record, hardworking immigrants, like the 100 who were carried off in the June raid of an Omaha meatpacking plant. The owner of that business described them as \"salt-of-the-earth, incredible people who helped build this company.\"\n\nHowever you feel success on immigration policy \"should be\" measured, work is the singular common factor that can be counted on. There's no better assimilation tool than employment itself to offer what Emma Lazraus described, in \"The New Colossus,\" as the tired, poor and huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\n\nThose with honest records of employment and service - who've proven to contribute to the American way - deserve grace ... and a measured path to permanence.\n\nTo the Point: Immigration: Let Business Take Over\n\nTo the Point: A 'Rant Continued' As Memorial Day Approaches ...",

        "body": "By Filipa Gaspar\n\nA young woman saves $664 a month on bills - after ditching her flat and moving into a 48-foot houseboat.\n\nLucy Barwick, 28, was sick of paying $1,600-a-month for a three-bedroom flat with her ex partner in Bedminster, Bristol.\n\nThe wholesale operator was looking for a \"viable option\" with space for her and her cat Mr. Biscuits.\n\nShe took out a loan to buy a dark green and white houseboat which cost over $100k.\n\nAnd moved into the boat in May 2024 with her ex-partner in the Bristol Marina.\n\nBut after they broke up Lucy decided to keep the boat as it was \"affordable enough\" for her to keep living on it.\n\nDespite Lucy \"loving\" her boat life, she experienced freezing weather, had to learn how to emptying the toilet and refill her water.\n\nShe said she has so far saved \"a lot of money\" and explained how she used to pay $1,100 for bills and rent and on the boat she is only spending $600.\n\nLucy said: \"I can still afford to live here on my own whereas I couldn't afford to live by myself on a flat.\n\n\"The community is so nice I know all of my neighbors and financially I am better off here if I had bought a flat because here I can fully pay my loan off in a couple of years and there's no 30 year mortgage.\n\n\"I wasn't a boat person as such but it is really livable and manageable - I love it, it is my home.\n\n\"The location is really good as well. If I was looking for a flat in this area would be potentially smaller than the boat it would be $2,000 and I couldn't get my head around that.\"\n\nWhen Lucy moved to her three-bed flat she was spending $1,200 - which was the top end of her budget.\n\nBut then it went up to $1,600 within three years of her living there, she said.\n\nLucy added: \"We were looking to buy in the Bedminster area thinking there is no way we can afford a BS1.\n\n\"We were looking at flats that were $300k and they were so uninspiring - some of them didn't even have windows.\n\n\"We saw this boat on Rightmove so we thought if it would be a viable option for us and it worked out.\n\n\"The narrowboat was ready to live in and they only repaired the walls and added their furniture in.\n\n\"We had to get rid of quite a lot of stuff. We were moving from a three-bedroom flat into a one-bed boat.\n\n\"It made us re-access what we actually need. We accumulated stuff over the three years.\"\n\nAnd despite moving on to a boat 48ft long and 12ft wide Lucy says it is not \"much different\" from living in a flat.\n\nShe said: \"For the first three months I was waiting for it all to hit me and think 'what have we done.'\n\n\"But actually whenever I have people over they say how much it feels like a flat.\n\n\"I always say that we can do much more on the boat than we could with the flat because we have got an outside space - the roof is basically our garden.\n\n\"We can have people over for barbeques and things which didn't use to be an option. \"\n\nBut living on a boat is not just positives, as Lucy explains how she has to keep on top of maintenance as problems like rust can highly damage boats.\n\nAnd she also had to adapt to the weather changes she feels on the boat.\n\nLucy explained: \"In the summer it's quite nice because it is generally quite cool because of the water.\n\n\"In the winter it can get cold overnight it can really chilled out and it can cool down.\n\n\"When the temperature drops in the morning you can really feel it.\n\n\"Emptying the toilet is a weekly task and you have got to get use to it especially in the winter. I have always managed to do that when the weather is not too bad.\n\n\"There have been times I have forgotten to refill the water tank and then the shower starts flustering and that's not great.\"\n\nShe hasn't learned how to move the boat and hasn't turned the engine on yet. But it is not something she is hoping to do in the near future.\n\n\"It sounds like a great idea being able to take your home away but for me when we moved on we moved on thinking this is relatively static.\n\n\"I just love my boat life,\" Lucy concluded.\n\nFOX41 Yakima©FOX11 TriCities©",

        "title": "Dozens killed as Palestinians in Gaza scramble for aid from air and land",
        "body": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Dozens of Palestinians were killed or wounded on Monday as desperate crowds headed toward food distribution points and airdropped parcels in the Gaza Strip, according to witnesses and local health officials.\n\nIsrael's blockade and military offensive have made it nearly impossible to safely deliver aid, contributing to the territory's slide toward famine nearly 22 months into the war with Hamas. Aid groups say Israel's week-old measures to allow more aid in are far from sufficient. Families of hostages in Gaza fear starvation affects them too, but blame Hamas.\n\nHamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nSeveral hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since May while heading toward food distribution sites and aid convoys, according to witnesses, local health officials and the United Nations human rights office. The military says it has only fired warning shots and disputes the toll.\n\nAs international alarm has mounted, several countries have airdropped aid over Gaza. The U.N. and aid groups call such drops costly and dangerous for residents, and say they deliver far less aid than trucks.\n\nMany food parcels dropped by air have splashed into the Mediterranean Sea or landed in so-called red zones from which Israel's military has ordered people to evacuate. In either case, Palestinians risk their lives to get flour and other basic goods.\n\nOn Monday, Palestinians cheered as pallets of aid were parachuted over Zuweida in central Gaza. Associated Press footage showed a desperate scramble when the parcels hit the ground, with hundreds of people racing toward them. Fistfights broke out and some men wielded batons.\n\n\"I wish they would deliver it through the (land) crossings,\" Rabah Rabah said earlier as he waited for the airdrop. \"This is inhuman.\"\n\nAt least one parcel fell on a tent where displaced people had been sheltering, injuring a man who was taken to a hospital. His condition was not immediately known.\n\nAt least 16 people were killed late Sunday near the Israeli-controlled Zikim Crossing, the main entry point for aid to northern Gaza, according to records at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, which showed that more than 130 people were wounded.\n\nThe circumstances were not immediately clear, but the crossing has seen several shootings in recent days that witnesses and health officials blamed on Israeli forces. There was no immediate comment from the military.\n\nAt least 10 people were killed as thousands waited for aid trucks in the Morag Corridor, which the Israeli military carved out between the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.\n\nMohammed al-Masri, who was among the crowds, said Israeli forces opened fire when a group of young men tried to make their way to the front. \"The occupation forces shot many people in the head and in the back,\" he said, adding that he saw four wounded people, one motionless on the ground.\n\nNasser Hospital in Khan Younis said it received 10 bodies from Morag and another five who were killed near an aid site in southern Gaza run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an Israeli-backed American contractor.\n\nGHF said there were no violent incidents at or near its sites. It said a new U.N. route runs near two of its sites in the south and has drawn large crowds of people who unload the convoys. GHF says its contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots on a few occasions to prevent deadly crowding since it opened four sites in May.\n\nAl-Awda Hospital in central Gaza said it received the bodies of eight people killed near a GHF site in the Israeli-controlled Netzarim Corridor, and that another 50 people were wounded. Witnesses and health officials said Israeli forces had fired toward the crowds.\n\nAn Associated Press photo showed a man carrying a body away from the site, as others hauled bags of food.\n\n\"It's like yesterday, and the day before,\" said Ayman Ruqab, a young Palestinian who said he had tried unsuccessfully to reach the site for the past three days. \"It's a death trap.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said it fired warning shots at people who approached \"in a manner that posed a threat to the troops,\" without elaborating. It said it was not aware of any casualties.\n\nHamas-led terrorists killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. They still hold 50 hostages, around 20 of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military offensive has killed more than 60,900 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says around half the dead have been women and children, is staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and other independent experts view its figures as the most reliable casualty count.\n\nIsrael has disputed the figures but hasn't provided its own.",

        "body": "(ANSA) - MILANO, 04 AGO - L'acquisto del Pirellino è stata \"la più grande fregatura che io abbia mai subito\". E poi è \"impossibile\" che una società \"come siamo noi, che lo dico con umiltà (...) intendo dire un soggetto che ha una responsabilità nei confronti di Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. di Intesa San Paolo, (...) vada a scegliere i professionisti perché sono nella commissione paesaggistica\". E' un passaggio dell'interrogatorio reso lo scorso 23 luglio, davanti al gip Mattia Fiorentini, dal fondatore di Coima, Manfredi Catella, da giovedì scorso agli arresti domiciliari nell'ambito dell'inchiesta sulla gestione dell'urbanistica a Milano, per una presunta corruzione di Alessandro Scandurra, il professionista componente dell'organismo comunale deputato a dare i pareri ai progetti di rigenerazione urbanistica della città, attraverso incarichi di consulenze retribuite. Una ricostruzione che per Catella, e lo ripete due volte è \"impossibile, impossibile. Ma perché dovremmo fare una cosa di questo tipo, esponendoci a questa cosa che stiamo vivendo, che io sto vivendo oggi e che chiaramente mi preoccupa moltissimo?\". La torre Pirelli 39, \"la più grande fregatura che io ho avuto\" era stata comprata da Coima per 193 milioni, ma \"nel febbraio del 2020, quindi praticamente dopo due mesi dal rogito, l'Assessore Maran, l'allora assessore all'urbanistica\" promuove \"l'Ers sul Pirellino e decide (..) questo vincolo\", a cui \"ci opponiamo non perché noi siamo contrari all'Ers, ma tu mi hai venduto un edificio a destinazione libera e poi me lo cambi, e come se uno compra un appartamento e poi uno ti dice: 'Guarda, quelle due camere le devi affittare gratis'\". Da lì è nato il contenzioso, ancora aperto, e la richiesta danni per 69 milioni al Comune. (ANSA).",

        "title": "TN BJP slams Chidambaram, Stalin over allegations on voter roll manipulation",
        "body": "Chennai, Aug 4 (SocialNews.XYZ) Tamil Nadu BJP spokesperson A.N.S. Prasad has strongly criticised former Union Minister P. Chidambaram and Chief Minister M.K. Stalin for what he termed as \"divisive and baseless\" statements regarding the recent revisions in voter rolls in Bihar and Tamil Nadu.\n\nPrasad accused the Congress-DMK alliance of attempting to undermine the integrity of the Election Commission of India (ECI) and distract from governance failures in Tamil Nadu.\n\nChidambaram had recently alleged that the ECI had removed 65 lakh voters from the electoral rolls in Bihar and added 6.5 lakh new voters in Tamil Nadu, describing the developments as suspicious and potentially illegal.\n\nCountering this, Prasad said these claims were made without constitutional understanding or reference to electoral procedures and were aimed at maligning the Modi-led central government.\n\n\"These allegations not only lack evidence but are also a deliberate attempt to erode public trust in our democratic institutions,\" Prasad said, adding that the Congress and DMK were resorting to \"divisive and dynastic politics\" to destabilise the idea of a unified Bharat.\n\nPrasad asserted that the removal of voters in Bihar was part of a routine Special Intensive Revision exercise conducted by the ECI under the provisions of Article 324 of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, 1950.\n\nHe clarified that such exercises are standard practices meant to eliminate duplicate, deceased, or relocated entries from the electoral rolls and that affected individuals have legal recourse to appeal for reinstatement.\n\nSimilarly, he dismissed Chidambaram's concerns about the inclusion of 6.5 lakh voters in Tamil Nadu, stating that migrant workers from other states are constitutionally entitled to register as voters at their current place of residence under Article 19(1)(e) and Section 19(b) of the Representation of the People Act.\n\n\"Labelling these voters as 'non-residents' is a rhetorical exaggeration, not a legal argument,\" he said.\n\nTurning his focus to Tamil Nadu, Prasad said the state was facing a serious governance crisis under the DMK, with rising incidents of crime, drug abuse, custodial deaths, and administrative corruption.\n\nHe cited the Anju Lavanya case as evidence of the deteriorating law and order situation, and condemned the state government's alleged crackdown on peaceful protests and hunger strikes by disgruntled trade unions.\n\n\"While Tamil Nadu's citizens are grappling with real challenges, Chidambaram and Stalin are busy peddling conspiracy theories and slandering constitutional bodies like the ECI,\" Prasad said.\n\n\"This is political posturing, not responsible leadership.\"\n\nHe also accused Stalin of aligning with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to further divisive regional politics, and criticised both leaders for ignoring linguistic and governance issues within their states in favour of partisan rhetoric. Prasad emphasised that the ECI functions with transparency, displaying draft rolls publicly and offering grievance redressal mechanisms.\n\nHe warned that casting aspersions on the ECI's impartiality without proof undermines the credibility of the electoral process. Highlighting the BJP's performance in the recent general elections, Prasad said the people of India have overwhelmingly rejected the Congress-DMK alliance's politics of division and entrusted Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a third consecutive term.\n\n\"This is a clear endorsement of the BJP's vision for a Viksit Bharat by 2047 -- an inclusive, united, and developed nation,\" he said.\n\nHe concluded by urging political leaders to focus on constructive engagement and real issues like voter awareness and accessibility rather than indulging in defamatory narratives.\n\n\"Tamil Nadu's people deserve leadership committed to justice, safety, and development - not sensationalism and slander,\" he added.",

        "body": "Rice bowls topped with tasty slivers of beef, chicken, egg, tempura or seafood have ancient roots in Japan and other parts of Asia. But the hearty, one-bowl dishes are also incredibly popular on American tables, given their wide variety and ease of preparation.\n\nThese days, it's just as easy to find a smoothie-like acai bowl made with fresh fruit and granola when you're out to eat as it is a poke bowl comprised of raw fish, rice and other toppings. Ditto with a grain bowl that pairs a protein with fresh veggies for a complete meal.\n\nWhen it comes to a making a dinner everyone will cheer, being able to customize ingredients is a big selling point, not just for flavor and texture but also dietary preferences and allergies. If you can't eat a certain food or just don't like it, there's usually a suitable substitute.\n\nBowls also are popular because they make it easy save a buck. Affordable, everyday staples like carrots, peppers and onions are often common ingredients. And because the meat or protein is chopped or sliced into bite-sized pieces, you can stretch what normally might feed one or two into something that satisfies three or four.\n\nThe same can be said for the sauces that ties everything together. Something as simple as soy sauce mixed with sugar and ginger can add lots of flavor for just pennies.\n\nThis budget menu for two makes the most of pork chops I got on sale, and a bag of one of my favorite (and easiest) appetizers of all time -- shishito peppers.\n\nIf I don't have a list firmly in hand when I head to the grocery store, I usually have at least a fairly good idea of what I want to cook that day or week. But it also benefits home cooks to be flexible about the menu when they happen upon an ingredient that's priced just right.\n\nThis week, it was a 1-pound package of five boneless pork chops for $4.54 and a $1.19 can of pineapple. Along with some fresh veggies, they laid the groundwork for a nutritious and lower-cal rice bowl that took only about 20 minutes from start to finish in a hot pan and a rice cooker.\n\nThe shishitos, which you can sometimes find at farmers markets in summer and also in larger grocery stores, took even less time to prepare -- around 8 minutes, or until they blister in spots when fried in a little oil.\n\nAt $3.99 for an 8-ounce bag, the peppers were definitely a splurge compared with the two rice bowls, which totaled just $6.83 (a mere $3.42 per serving). But they are so tasty, seasonal and easy to whip up I couldn't resist. Besides, haven't we all had our fill of salad as a starter?\n\nBrownies won't start any trends when it comes to dessert, but when baked in a skillet, they're a bit more fun. In the past, I've enhanced brownies with chili powder and nuts; for this batch, I added white chocolate chips for a spot of color. But you won't go wrong with milk or dark chocolate chips or baking them naked without add-ins.\n\nI built the bowls with inexpensive white rice to stay on a $15 budget, but if you're willing to spend a bit more they also can be made with any other favorite grain, including quinoa, brown rice, farro or even wheat berries.\n\nAs always in this on-going series, the final tally excludes ingredients I had on hand and you probably do, too -- soy sauce, carrots, cooking oil, white sugar and vanilla. The most exciting purchase this week was eggs -- just $2.99 a dozen at my local store, about half of what I was paying just a few months ago.\n\nAll told, I came out more than $2 under budget and even had leftovers.\n\nPG tested\n\nNative to Japan, but incredibly popular on American menus, shishito peppers are almost always eaten while they are bright green. (They turn red as they ripen.) They are hotter then bell peppers, but fall below jalapeños on the Scoville scale. But be forewarned: one in 10 packs some serious heat.\n\nHere, the wrinkled peppers are quickly cooked in a hot pan or on a grill until they char and blister. All that's really needed to make them pop on the plate is a sprinkle of flaky salt. You also could go \"fancy\" and garnish them with a little citrus zest, some smoked paprika or a sprinkle of sumac, a tangy Mediterranean spice made from pulverized dried sumac berries.\n\nHeat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, just until it begins to smoke, about 3 minutes\n\nAdd peppers to pan and cook, without stirring, until skins are blistered, 3-5 minutes. Oil will pop, so you could use a lid on the skillet and leave it slightly ajar to avoid spatters.\n\nUse tongs to flip the peppers. Continue cooking over medium-high heat until blistered on the other side, 3-5 minutes.\n\nTransfer peppers to a serving dish and season generously with flaked salt. Let cool a minute or two before serving.\n\nWhether you plan on eating your rice bowl with a spoon, fork or chopsticks, everything on top of the rice should be cut into bite-sized pieces. I used bell peppers and broccoli, but any favorite veggie that's in season works. Leave out the chilies if you want to tame the heat or add more if you prefer spicier dishes. Brown rice is always a more nutritious choice than white, but you gotta choose your battles, right?\n\n1/2 pound boneless pork chops, cut into bite-sized chunks (around 3 pork chops)\n\n1/2 medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and chopped\n\n1 serrano or jalapeno chile, stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced\n\n1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks\n\nIn medium bowl, combine pork, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1/2 tablespoon sugar and the cornstarch, and toss until pork is evenly coated.\n\nAdd oil to a skillet and heat over medium-heat until shimmering.\n\nAdd pork in an even layer and cook, stirring occasionally, until pork is lightly browned, 4-5 minutes.\n\nAdd bell pepper, broccoli and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are lightly browned and fork tender, 4-5 minutes.\n\nAdd pineapple, chilies and ginger, then cook, stirring occasionally, until pineapple begins to brown, about 2 minutes.\n\nStir in vinegar, remaining tablespoon soy sauce and another pinch or two of sugar. Cook, stirring often, until meat and vegetables are lightly coated with the sauce, 1-2 minutes.\n\nRemove from heat, taste and season with more soy sauce and vinegar as needed.\n\nSpoon cooked rice into two bowls. Divide pork mixture on top of rice, and sprinkle with the scallions, if desired.\n\nServes 2.\n\n-- adapted from \"Milk Street: 365\" by Christopher Kimball\n\nPG tested\n\nIf you like, these easy dessert brownies can be mixed and baked in the same pan, reducing cleanup. For even more chocolate flavor, add chocolate chips. You could also stir in some coffee granules to intensify the richness. They are on the crumbly side, so if you can wait (we know -- it's hard!) allow them to cool completely in the pan before cutting into wedges.\n\nMelt butter in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Scrape butter into a bowl with a spatula and set skillet aside,\n\nIn medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.\n\nAdd brown sugar and oil to bowl and stir until well combined.\n\nAdd egg and vanilla and whisk until smooth.\n\nAdd flour mixture to butter mixture and stir until just combined and no flour is visible. Add chocolate or white chocolate chips and stir until evenly distributed.\n\nScrape dough into the empty cast-iron skillet. Spread and push dough into an even layer covering the bottom of the skillet.\n\nTransfer skillet to oven and bake until edges of cookie are set and top looks dry and shiny 16-18 minutes.\n\nRemove skillet to a cooling rack, and let cool for 30 minutes.\n\nUse a butter knife to cut cookie into wedges, being careful not to scratch surface of skillet. Serve.\n\nServes 6-8.\n\n-- adapted form \"The Complete Cook Book for Teen Chefs\" by America's Test Kitchen\n\n©2025 PG Publishing Co. Visit at post-gazette.com.

        "body": "A possible UNSC Spartan x Power Rangers team up might be on the way.\n\nEpic has revealed a new Halo-inspired Fortnite collaboration. Only this time, the focus isn't centered solely on Master Chief but on UNSC Spartans as a whole; players will be able to gain access to these colorful skins via Fortnite's upcoming battle pass when Season 4 goes live on August 7.\n\nEpic broke the news through the Fortnite X/Twitter page. There, the company informed fans of the upcoming battle pass as well as hint at a possible Power Ranger sighting; a fan asked if the rangers were making their debut, to which the account responded with a few promising emojis.\n\nOf course, this isn't the first time we've seen a Halo x Fortnite event. Master Chief joined Fortnite's legacy series back in 2020--he was added to the shop during Chapter 2, Season 5 as a standalone or bundled purchase. Players could don his armor in two different colors, wield his gravity hammer pickaxe, float with the UNSC Pelican Glider, and even ride a mini warthog via a special emote.\n\nThis would be the first time players will get to play as the Power Rangers though. If the rumors/leaks are true--as suggested by popular Fortnite leaker Shiina--we'd expect them to show up as a bonus that's unlocked through specific quests or maybe as a high-tier achievement on the battle pass. Whatever the case, Fortnite fans seem to be in for an out-of-this-world treat come August 7.",

But their options are limited.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nJudge says the Trump administration can't withhold research funding on LGBTQ+ issues\n\nThe federal judge ruled the administration can't enforce any guidelines that bar federal funding for research because it deals with gender identity, sexual orientation or diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nMaryland-based U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden, made the ruling Friday in a lawsuit filed by the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights and individual researchers.\n\nShe had previously paused enforcement, but has now put it on hold while the case works its way through court.\n\nIn their May filing, the researchers said the National Institutes of Health were denying funds.\n\nTrump's deadline for the Kremlin looms but Putin shows no sign of making concessions\n\nThe coming week could mark a pivotal moment in the war between Russia and Ukraine, as Trump's deadline for the Kremlin to reach a peace deal approaches -- or it could quietly pass without consequence.\n\nTrump's special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow midweek, just before Trump's Friday deadline for the Kremlin to stop the killing or face potentially severe economic penalties from Washington.\n\nSo far Trump's promises, threats and cajoling have failed to shift the Kremlin's position, and the stubborn diplomatic stalemate remains in place. Meanwhile, Ukraine is losing more territory on the front line, although there's no sign of a looming collapse of its defenses.\n\nWitkoff is expected to land in the Russian capital Wednesday or Thursday, according to Trump, following his trip to Israel and Gaza.\n\n▶ Read more about the war between Russia and Ukraine\n\nUS tariffs put 30,000 South African jobs at risk, officials say\n\nThat came Monday, four days before a 30% U.S. tariff on most imports from South Africa kicks in.\n\nSouth Africa was slapped with one of the highest tariff rates by its third-largest trading partner -- after China and the EU -- creating uncertainty for the future of some export industries and catapulting a scramble for new markets outside the U.S. Tariffs come into effect Aug. 8.\n\nIn an update on mitigation measures, a senior government official warned an estimated 30,000 jobs were in jeopardy if the response to the higher tariffs was \"mismanaged\".\n\n\"We base this on the ongoing consultations that we have with all the sectors of the economy from automotive, agriculture and all the other sectors that are going to be impacted,\" said Simphiwe Hamilton, director-general of the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition.\n\nSouth Africa is already grappling with stubbornly high unemployment rates.\n\n▶ Read more about tariffs on South Africa\n\nTrump again knocks India for buying Russian oil\n\nThe president said in a post on Truth Social that India is buying \"massive amounts\" of oil from Russia and then \"selling it on the Open Market for big profits.\"\n\n\"They don't care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA,\" he said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if Trump was announcing higher rates than those he announced last week, when he said the U.S. would impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of the purchases of Russian oil.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nSchumer and Jeffries request meeting this week of the 'big four'\n\nThe top two Democratic leaders in Congress have asked the top two Republican leaders for a meeting this week to discuss a path forward for funding the federal government after the current budget year ends Sept. 30.\n\nWhen lawmakers return to Washington after Labor Day, they'll have four weeks to avoid a partial government shutdown. Democrats are also looking to prevent the expiration at the end of the year of enhanced tax credits designed to make health insurance coverage more affordable for enrollees in Affordable Care Act plans. Millions will see higher premiums when the credits expire.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans have the responsibility to work on a bipartisan basis to avert a \"painful, unnecessary shutdown.\" They were also critical of the GOP's recent efforts to use their majority to pass Trump's massive tax and spending cut bill.\n\n\"Today, we wish to reiterate that we should pursue a bipartisan path -- you can work with us to protect health care for the American people and chart a better course for this country,\" said the letter sent to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nState Department proposes making some visa applicants post an up to $15k bond to apply to enter US\n\nIt would apply to applicants for business and tourist visas.\n\nIn a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, the department said it would start a 12-month pilot program under which visa applicants from countries deemed to have high overstay rates and deficient internal document security controls could be required to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 when they apply for a visa.\n\nA preview of the notice, which was posted online at the Federal Register website Monday, said the pilot program would take effect within 15 days of its formal publication and is necessary to ensure the U.S. government isn't financially liable if a visitor doesn't comply with the terms of their visa.\n\nThe bond, which would be refunded as long as the terms of the visa are complied with, wouldn't apply to citizens of countries enrolled in the Visa Waiver Program and could be waived for others depending on an applicants' individual circumstances.\n\nTrump says 'Go get 'em' to actor Sydney Sweeney and bemoans 'woke'\n\nThe president posted on Truth Social about Sweeney's jeans ad for American Eagle Outfitters, the second time in the last 24 hours in which he weighed in on the controversy over the ad, which sparked a debate over race and Western beauty standards.\n\nTrump, misspelling Sweeney's first name, said it was \"the HOTTEST ad out there.\"\n\n\"It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are 'flying of the shelves.' Go get 'em Sidney,\" Trump said in his post.\n\nIn the same post, Trump complained about advertisements from Bud Light (which he also misspelled) and Jaguar, along with renewing his complaints about singer Taylor Swift, declaring them all \"woke.\"\n\nTexas governor threatens to remove Democrats who left state over Trump-backed redistricting\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says he'll begin trying to remove Democratic lawmakers from office Monday if they don't return after dozens of them left the state in a last-resort attempt to block redrawn U.S. House maps that President Trump wants before the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe revolt by the state House Democrats, many of whom went to Illinois or New York on Sunday, and Abbott giving them less than 24 hours to come home ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but has drawn in Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state's maps in retaliation. Their options, however, are limited.\n\nAt the center of the escalating impasse is Trump's pursuit of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before next year that would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority.\n\n▶ Read more about the redistricting effort in Texas\n\nTrump's Monday schedule\n\nThe only thing on President Trump's public schedule today is a lunch with Vice President JD Vance at 12:30 p.m., according to the White House.\n\nTrump attacks Charlamagne Tha God after radio host criticizes his presidency\n\nTrump on Sunday lashed out at radio host Charlamagne Tha God, saying in a social media post that the popular broadcaster \"knows nothing about me or what I have done.\"\n\nTrump's comments came a day after Charlamagne, whose real name is Lenard McKelvey, criticized Trump on Fox News.\n\nAsked how he would rate Trump's presidency, the radio host said, \"I wouldn't give it a good rating simply because the least of us are still being impacted the worst.\"\n\nTrump said on Truth Social that Charlamagne was a \"dope\" who voted for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nCharlamagne said he personally will benefit from tax breaks approved in Trump's tax-and-spending law, but said, \"There's going to be so many people that's hurt by that bill.''\n\n\"Anything that takes away Medicaid from people and will put people in a worse financial situation than they were previously in, I'm not for,\" he added.\n\nCharlamagne, who co-hosts a nationally syndicated radio show, \"The Breakfast Club,\" added that his criticism of the Republican president was not new, adding that he \"gave President Biden the same hell.\"\n\n▶ Read more about Charlamagne's comments\n\nSmithsonian denies White House pressure to remove Trump impeachment references\n\nThe White House did not pressure the Smithsonian to remove references to Trump's two impeachments from an exhibit and will include him in an updated presentation \"in the coming weeks,\" the museum said Saturday.\n\nThe revelation that Trump was no longer listed among impeached presidents sparked concern that history was being whitewashed to appease the president.\n\n\"We were not asked by any Administration or other government official to remove content from the exhibit,\" the Smithsonian statement said.\n\nA museum spokesperson, Phillip Zimmerman, had previously pledged that \"a future and updated exhibit will include all impeachments,\" but it was not clear when the new exhibit would be installed. The museum on Saturday did not say when in the coming weeks the new exhibit will be ready.\n\n▶ Read more about the Smithsonian and Trump\n\nIt's Trump's economy now. The latest financial numbers offer some warning signs\n\nFor all of President Donald Trump's promises of an economic \"golden age,\" a spate of weak indicators last week told a potentially worrisome story as the impacts of his policies are coming into focus.\n\nJob gains are dwindling. Inflation is ticking upward. Growth has slowed compared with last year.\n\nMore than six months into his term, Trump's blitz of tariff hikes and his new tax and spending bill have remodeled America's trading, manufacturing, energy and tax systems to his own liking. He's eager to take credit for any wins that might occur and is hunting for someone else to blame if the financial situation starts to totter.\n\nBut as of now, this is not the boom the Republican president promised, and his ability to blame his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any economic challenges has faded as the world economy hangs on his every word and social media post.\n\n▶ Read more about the state of the U.S. economy under Trump\n\nFOX41 Yakima©FOX11 TriCities©",

I love this festival -- there are lots of concerts, and the place is very pretty,\" he said.\n\nOrganisers expect around 2,000 spectators over the nine-day event that runs until August 9 in this town of just 4,000 residents, where Frederic Chopin's legacy is visible everywhere.\n\n\"Above all, this festival brings together true enthusiasts of Chopin's music,\" said Piotr Paleczny, the festival's artistic director.\n\nStreets are adorned with posters and statues of the composer and shops welcome tourists with souvenirs bearing his image.\n\nIt was here in 1826, when the town was part of Germany and known as Bad Reinerz, where a 16-year-old Chopin gave his first concert abroad.\n\nThat performance inspired the creation of the festival, which has attracted many of classical music's biggest names since its founding in 1946.\n\nOne of this year's performers is Warsaw-born pianist Julia Lozowska, 23.\n\n\"I grew up with Chopin. I love many other composers, of course, but he's the one I understand best,\" she said.\n\nAmong the festival's headliners is Aristo Sham, 29, a prodigy from Hong Kong and winner of the 2025 Van Cliburn Competition. He is launching his world tour in Duszniki-Zdroj.\n\n\"To play in the same venue as him, to follow in his footsteps -- it's a huge honour and privilege,\" Sham said after a rehearsal, his eyes resting on a bust of Chopin.\n\n\"Here, we're in a musical cocoon, just playing music in an enchanting setting for an incredibly enthusiastic audience.\"\n\nstr/dt/js",

        "title": "Changemakers: Ken Young, President and CEO, United Church Homes",
        "body": "Meet Ken Young, president and CEO of United Church Homes (UCH) -- a faith-based non-profit senior living provider based in Ohio with more than 90 owned or operated senior living communities. Dating back to its first \"home for the aged\" in 1916, the company now operates in 15 states across the full care continuum and offers management services in addition to its owned properties.\n\nHaving served previously as president of UCH, Young has a wealth of experience in senior living operations, growth and change management. His perspective includes managing a mission-driven organization that offers care across settings, including market rate communities. In this Changemakers interview, Young shares his views on the incoming generation of senior living residents, what needs to change in anticipation and his advice for driving change along the way.\n\nIn what ways do you think the senior living industry is changing right now?\n\nThe industry is shifting toward aging in place, with 90% of seniors preferring to stay home (AARP). NaviGuide, our personalized service coordination program, helps reduce residential care needs by connecting seniors to healthcare and community resources.\n\nWe're also seeing more tech integration, like telehealth and a focus on affordability through middle-market housing. Also, a faster pace of change driven by evolving customer expectations requires operators to be nimble.\n\nIn what ways do you think senior living operators need to change for the incoming generation of older adults?\n\nThe incoming generation of older adults seeks flexibility, purpose and community. Operators must offer customizable options, wellness programs and meaningful connections, focusing on human-centered care that supports physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. At United Church Homes, our middle-market housing initiatives aim to empower this generation to live with purpose and belonging.\n\nHow do you think the senior living industry can change to better educate prospective residents and their families in the years ahead?\n\nWe need to educate earlier, starting at high school or college, to remove the stigma around senior care. Transparent storytelling about resident experiences builds trust. Partnering with healthcare providers for informational sessions can also clarify options, helping families make informed decisions with less anxiety.\n\nIn what ways can senior living companies change the public's perception of the industry?\n\nHighlighting programs like NaviGuide and middle-market housing counters institutional stereotypes, showing how we enable independence. Personalized media campaigns with vibrant resident stories can redefine senior living as a partner in connection and quality of life in addition to the quality of care that is provided.\n\nTell us about some of your recent efforts to change the senior living industry for the better.\n\nWe've expanded NaviGuide to help older adults age in place, focusing on personalized care coordination. Our middle-market housing growth emphasizes wrap-around services, wellness and social connection. Additionally, our Center for Abundant Aging provides educational resources to combat ageism and address senior living challenges, fostering a more inclusive industry.\n\nIs the senior living industry moving quickly enough to change in the ways it needs to?\n\nProgress is evident, especially post-COVID, but affordability, technology and personalization need faster adoption. We must move at a pace our resources allow to ensure sustainable change.\n\nChange is hard. Can you talk about a time when you tried to execute a change and things didn't go according to plan? How did you pivot, and what did you learn as a leader?\n\nChange often meets resistance due to human nature. I've learned transparency is key -- frequent communication about the \"why\" helps people embrace change.\n\nWhen a past initiative faltered, we pivoted by increasing clarity and engagement, reinforcing that change is essential for growth and those we serve.\n\nWhat's the biggest change you ever made in your career or life? How did it go and what did you learn?\n\nLeaving my law firm partnership 20 years ago to become general counsel at United Church Homes was pivotal. It went well, teaching me to trust my gut, follow my calling, be authentic and not to be afraid to ask for help along the way. My belief in UCH's mission and core values has guided my leadership journey.\n\nWhat advice do you have for other senior living companies implementing their own changemaking efforts?\n\nListen to residents, staff and trends. Create a culture of experimentation, learn from failures and partner with innovators. Align changes with your mission and core values -- one size doesn't fit all. At United Church Homes, our success stems from staying true to our mission and to what we believe serves our residents and communities best.\n\nIf you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about the senior living industry, what would it be and why?\n\nI'd increase healthcare reimbursement to cover operating costs, allowing a margin to expand mission-driven services and technology -- benefiting everyone.\n\nWhat fictional character would you enlist to help change the senior living industry for the better this year?\n\nTed Lasso -- his authentic leadership, humor and ability to unite and motivate diverse individuals into a cohesive team to BELIEVE in the impossible would inspire the industry to achieve transformative change together.\n\nPretend the senior living industry is a streaming service. What movie or television series best describes the industry right now? And if you could change to a new movie or television series, what would it be and why?\n\nRight now it's The Amazing Race -- fast-paced, adapting to challenges like NaviGuide, middle-market efforts and continuous operational improvement in our licensed healthcare. I'd shift to This Is Us, emphasizing belonging and growth, reflecting a future where senior living embraces deep, meaningful support for all.",

While it was a solid game from Atlanta, they did get some tough news in the form of an injury sustained by third baseman Austin Riley.\n\nRecently, David O'Brien of The Athletic broke down the next steps the Braves are taking in the wake of the ailment.\n\n\"#Braves put Austin Riley back on the 10-day IL with a lower abdominal strain and recalled INF Nacho Alvarez Jr. from Triple-A Gwinnett,\" reported O'Brien on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nO'Brien also noted that \"the team recalled INF Jonathan Ornelas and optioned OF Jarred Kelenic to Gwinnett.\"\n\nIt's been a tough season for Austin Riley in 2025, as he is one of the many Braves players who have shown regression from previous years amid what has overall been a disastrous campaign for Atlanta.\n\nThe Braves entered this season with legitimate World Series contention hopes after not having won a playoff series since their championship win in 2021.\n\nHowever, a combination of significant regression from several important players along with some key injuries, particularly along the pitching staff, have kept the Braves well short of those lofty aspirations.\n\nMany expected the Braves to be sellers at the recent MLB trade deadline due to their record, but the team surprised fans by mostly remaining stagnant and holding onto the core that got them to their current record of 47-63.\n\nStill, major changes could be coming this offseason, with longtime manager Brian Snitker expected to retire and potentially more transactions on the way.\n\nIn any case, the Braves will next take the field on Monday evening for the first game of a home series against the Milwaukee Brewers.",

        "title": "India and the Philippines stage joint naval drill in the disputed South China Sea",
        "body": "MANILA, Philippines -- India and the Philippines have staged joint naval exercises in the disputed South China Sea for the first time, a high-profile military deployment that antagonized China. Beijing has separate territorial disputes with the two Asian democracies and a long-running regional rivalry with New Delhi.\n\nArmed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner said Monday that the two-day joint naval sail and exercises which began Sunday went successfully, and expressed hopes that Filipino forces could engage India's military in more joint maneuvers in the future.\n\nAsked if Chinese forces carried out any action in response, Brawner said without elaborating that \"we did not experience any untoward incident but we were still shadowed. We expected that already.\"\n\nTwo Chinese navy ships, including a guided-missile destroyer, were spotted about 25 nautical miles (46 kilometers) from one of two Philippine navy frigates that participated in the joint sail on Sunday, the Philippine military said.\n\nThe Chinese military's Southern Theater Command said it conducted routine patrols in the South China Sea on Sunday and Monday and added that it remains resolute in defending China's territory and maritime rights and interests.\n\nWithout mentioning India by name, the Southern Theater Command accused the Philippines of drawing in outside countries to organize joint patrols that it said undermine regional peace and stability.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry said territorial disputes should be resolved by those directly involved without any third-party intervention.\n\nChina has a longstanding land border dispute with India in the Himalayas, which sparked a monthlong war in 1962 and a number of deadly firefights since then.\n\nSeparately, Beijing's expansive claims to virtually the entire South China Sea, a key global trade route, have led to tense confrontations with other claimant states, particularly the Philippines and Vietnam. Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also lay claims to parts of the contested waters.\n\nThe Philippines has staged naval patrols in the disputed waters with its treaty ally, the United States, and other strategic partners including Japan, Australia, New Zealand and France to promote freedom of navigation and overflight and strengthen deterrence against China.\n\nIt has allowed journalists to join territorial sea and aerial patrols to witness China's increasingly aggressive actions, provoking angry Chinese reactions.\n\nIn response to a question last week about Manila's plans to build up military cooperation, China's Ministry of National Defense called the Philippines a \"troublemaker\" that has aligned itself with foreign forces to stir up trouble in what China deems its own territorial waters.\n\nBrawner said the Philippines has to boost deterrence to prevent war. \"The way to do that is, number one, the Armed Forces of the Philippines has to be strengthened through modernization, and secondly, we need to partner with like-minded nations and that's what we're doing with India,\" he said last week.\n\nDuring a reception on board an Indian navy tanker, the INS Shakti, on Thursday, Brawner said the vessel's port call in Manila was more than ceremonial. It \"sends a powerful signal of solidarity, strength in partnership and the energy of cooperation between two vibrant democracies in the Indo-Pacific,\" he said.\n\nBrawner welcomed the deepening of relations between the two Asian countries and \"reaffirmed the shared commitment to maritime security, regional stability and a rules-based international order in one of the world's most geopolitically sensitive regions.\"\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos left Monday for a five-day state visit to India for talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top officials to boost defense, trade and investment, agriculture, tourism and pharmaceutical industry engagements.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Ken Moritsugu in Beijing contributed to this report.",

The show is part of the band's Summer of Discontent tour.\n\nThe Dropkick Murphys have never been shy in their criticism of President Donald Trump, which is something Hoosiers might experience firsthand when the band takes the stage Tuesday in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Massachusetts-based punk rock group played an unflattering video of Trump during a rendition of \"First Class Loser\" at their July 27 Warped Tour performance in Long Beach, California. The video included footage Trump palling around with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIt's unknown whether the band will do the same again Tuesday in Indianapolis. Here's what happened.\n\nWhat did the Dropkick Murphy's say about Donald Trump?\n\n\"This next song is dedicated to a guy who wears orange makeup, (defecates) his pants in his diapers, rapes women, touches kids,\" said Dropkick Murphys vocalist Ken Casey. \"It's called 'First Class Loser.'\"\n\nTrump was found liable for sexual abuse in a 2023 civil court case against E. Jean Carroll, a lauded writer and a former graduate of Indiana University.\n\nCheck out a video of the song below, but mind the language.\n\nStory continues after photo gallery.\n\nDropkick Murphys criticize Trump and his MAGA supporters\n\nCasey has been vocal in his criticism about Trump and his supporters in recent months. The frontman delivered a pointed critique of MAGA hats during the band's show March 15 at MGM Music Hall in Boston.\n\n\"Silence is complicit at this point,\" Casey said during an interview with Boston radio station WBUR. \"So to be making fluff music about stuff that isn't of importance at the moment, I really just think is  shirking  away from the fight.\"\n\nThe Dropkick Murphys, natives of Quincy, Massachusetts, recently released the album \"For the People,\" which includes the anti-authoritarian anthem \"Who'll Stand with Us?\"\n\nWatch the Dropkick Murphys call Donald Trump a 'First Class Loser'\n\n(Warning: The following video contains strong language.)\n\nWhen do the Dropkick Murphys perform in Indianapolis?

Ticket presales launch at 10 a.m. Wednesday through Ticketmaster using the code \"WWETIX.\" Fans can also get tickets through Ford Center's box office.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment last came to town in 2023 for a broadcast of Smackdown. The shows technically feature separate rosters, but the wrestlers often bounce back and forth.\n\nThe RAW lineup boasts World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins, women's world champion Naomi, and intercontinental champ Dominik Mysterio, among others. Veteran favorites such as Rey Mysterio, CM Punk, AJ Styles and Sheamus are also in the mix.\n\nMonday's release didn't list ticket prices. According to Ticketmaster, however, they run anywhere from around $75 to more than $300, depending on the seats.\n\nThe announcement came mere hours after WWE wrapped up its annual SummerSlam at Met Life Stadium in New York - where an Indiana star almost stole the show.\n\nPlayoff hero and Indiana Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton sat front row and happily drank in the boos from a New York crowd still testy about the Pacers eliminating the Knicks from the postseason the last two years.\n\nRehabbing from the devastating Achilles tear he suffered in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Haliburton walked in on crutches. When WWE legend John Cena spotted him ringside, he snagged one of the crutches and used it to pummel opponent Cody Rhodes.\n\nRAW airs each Monday on Netflix.",

        "body": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A Chinese citizen was charged Monday under Australia's recent foreign interference laws with covertly collecting information about an Australian Buddhist association, police said.\n\nThe woman, an Australian permanent resident based in the capital Canberra, is only the third person charged since the laws were passed in 2018 and the first to be accused of interfering with the general population, Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Nutt police said.\n\nShe was charged in a Canberra court with covertly gathering information about a local branch of the Buddhist association Guan Yin Citta on behalf of the Public Security Bureau of China.\n\nThe association is banned in China. Police have not detailed her alleged objectives.\n\n\"We allege the activity was to support intelligence objectives of the China's Public Security Bureau. This is the first time the AFP has charged a person with foreign interference that allegedly involves targeting members of the Australian community,\" Nutt told reporters.\n\n\"Foreign interference is a serious crime that undermines democracy and social cohesion. It is a crime carried out by or on behalf of a foreign principal that involves covert and deceptive conduct or threats of serious harm or menacing demands,\" Nutt added.\n\nThe woman, who was arrested at her home Saturday, cannot be named publicly due to a court order. She was remanded in custody and faces a maximum 15 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Canberra did not immediately respond on Monday to a request for comment.\n\nShe is the first foreign national to be charged under the sweeping laws that created a rift between Australia and China when they were first announced in 2017.\n\nVietnam-born Melbourne businessman and local community leader Di Sanh Duong was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison last year over an attempt to influence a former federal government minister on behalf of China.\n\nSydney businessman Alexander Csergo also was charged with foreign interference for allegedly accepting payments for information from two suspected Chinese spies. He pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n\nMike Burgess, director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, said the nation's main domestic spy agency had made a signficant contribution to the latest arrest.\n\n\"Foreign interference of the kind alleged is an appalling assault on Australian values, freedoms and sovereignty,\" Burgess said in a statement.\n\nThe charge comes as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese mends bilateral relations with China that plumbed new lows under the previous Australian administration over issues including foreign interference laws.\n\nAlbanese traveled to Beijing last month to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the fourth time since the Australian leader was first elected in 2022.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON - The U.S. Senate confirmed Paige Hallen Hanson to serve as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Appointed by President Donald J. Trump, as CFO, Hanson will be responsible for overseeing nearly $100 billion currently appropriated for EPA's work, the development and management of EPA's annual budget, the agency's financial and resource management systems, and more than 300 employees.\n\n\"Paige brings a wealth of expertise in complex budgets and over two decades of government and financial experience to EPA. She understands the importance of stewarding every cent of taxpayer money and is uniquely and highly qualified to serve as EPA's Chief Financial Officer. I look forward to working with Paige in this new role to make EPA more transparent and efficient as we carry out our mission of protecting human health and the environment,\" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.\n\n\"I am tremendously grateful for the opportunity to lead EPA's financial operations,\" said EPA Chief Financial Officer Paige Hanson. \"From budgeting to payments, performance measures to financial technology, the work of this talented team enables the critical mission EPA plays in protecting human health and the environment.\"\n\nPrior to joining EPA, Hanson served as Senior Fellow at Tax Foundation and as a private sector CFO. She has extensive experience in financial operations and financial and economic public policy having served in the U.S. Senate on the Joint Economic Committee, Senate Budget Committee, and as finance policy staff for a Member of the Senate Appropriations and Finance Committees.\n\nShe also previously served as EPA's Associate CFO for Policy during President Trump's first term.\n\nHanson holds an MBA from Virginia Tech and an undergraduate degree in Government and Economics from Wofford College.\n\nHere's what people are saying about Paige Hanson's presidential appointment:\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R-SC): \"I am very pleased that South Carolina's own Paige Hanson has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate to be the Environmental Protection Agency's Chief Financial Officer. Originally from Lexington, Paige graduated from Wofford in the Upstate and went on to serve as a staffer in the U.S. Senate for seven years, specializing in financial issues. As Chief Financial Officer, Paige will be a great asset to Administrator Zeldin and the rest of the agency as they work to return it to its original mission: being good stewards of America's natural environment while also supporting economic growth.\"\n\nSenator Tim Scott (R-SC): \"I'm proud to support the confirmation of Paige Hanson, a native South Carolinian, as Chief Financial Officer of the Environmental Protection Agency. Paige brings proven financial expertise, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to public service that will serve the EPA and the American people well. South Carolina is proud to see one of our own take on such an important position in President Trump's administration, and I congratulate her on this well-deserved confirmation!\"\n\nSenator Katie Britt (R-AL): \"President Trump made a fantastic choice in nominating Paige Hanson as Chief Financial Officer for the EPA -- I was proud to vote to confirm her for this important position. I know her expertise will advance Administrator Zeldin's mission of achieving clean water, air, and land for all Americans while unleashing U.S. energy to onshore production, lower costs for families and businesses, and achieve energy dominance.\"\n\nFormer EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler: \"Paige did a great job as Associate CFO in the first Administration, she has the experience and knowledge the agency needs, and she displays all of the characteristics needed for a CFO.\"\n\nFormer EPA Chief of Staff Ryan Jackson: \"Paige Hanson is perfectly qualified to serve as EPA's Chief Financial Officer. She served as a senior official in EPA's financial office in the President's first term and has years of experience in budget and appropriations on Capitol Hill, but most importantly, she is one of the most conscientious and hard-working individuals with whom I have ever worked.\"",

        "title": "Callaway Opus SP wedges: What you need to know",
        "body": "What you need to know: Callaway's latest wedge introduction, the Opus SP, is designed to flight the ball lower to maximize control -- a desirable trait for increasing scoring opportunities. The wedge has earned the distinction of being Callaway's fastest adopted wedge on tour, with 34 in play at the Wyndham Championship.\n\nPrice/Availability: The Opus SP wedges are available for presale on Aug. 18 and in stores on Sept. 12. Price is $200 in steel and $210 in graphite.\n\n1. What's a wedge without spin? There's spin and then there's the right amount of spin. Callaway achieves the latter through a pair of technologies. The first is a two-piece design with a pocket low in the head that redistributes mass higher, thus raising the center of gravity to promote a lower, more penetrating flight. The result is more spin but with the kind of control needed to flight shots or attack tight pins.\n\nThe grooves received attention as well with a Callaway's team incorporating a new 17-degree groove angle and tighter pitch spacing to engage more groove edge contact. That produces more consistent spin across a variety of lies. The grooves combine with a deep cross-hatch laser pattern across the face to generate friction for more Rotweilller-like bite.\n\n2. Tour approved. The game's best have already taken to Callaway's newest wedge, with 32 players using Opus SP at the Genesis Scottish Open and 34 at the Wyndham Championship.\n\nAmong those putting it in play were two-time major champions Xander Schauffele and Jon Rahm along with Akshay Bhatia, Min Woo Lee, Thomas Detry, Rasmus Hojgaard and Nicolai Hojgaard.\n\n3. Grind it out. There is no shortage of options with the new line. Lofts range from 48 to 64 degrees in two-degree increments in two finishes: black shadow and brushed chrome. There are five grind options available as well, the S, T, C, W and the new X Grind that's back by popular demand. The X grind (available in the 54-, 56, 58- and 60-degree models) boasts a higher bounce for better shotmaking capabilities.",

Since this claim does not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement, this claim should not have been dismissed and sent to arbitration,\" the appeals court wrote, according to Fortune.\n\nAdditional legal proceedings will take place in the lower courts, per the outlet's report.",

        "title": "'Hit a Nerve and Rattled You': Charlamagne Tha God Rips Trump as 'Donkey of the Day' After President's 'Racist Sleazebag' Attack",
        "body": "Charlamagne Tha God wasn't even the main guest on Lara Trump's Fox Nation show, \"My View\" on Sunday. But his remarks about President Donald Trump's failed promises on the economy and his close ties to Jeffrey Epstein were enough to send the president into a full-blown tirade.\n\nShortly after the segment aired, Trump exploded on Truth Social, firing off a post that called The Breakfast Club host a \"racist sleazebag\" and a \"low-IQ individual.\" Trump then questioned why Charlamagne was \"allowed to use the word 'GOD'\" in his name and accused him of knowing \"nothing about me or what I have done.\"\n\nHours later, Charlamagne fired back at Trump in his own post.\n\n\"President Trump was better off going after Urkel, tho because he is really Scraping The Bottom of The Black Barrel coming at me,\" Charlamagne wrote on Instagram, then named others who Trump has recently targeted over the airwaves. \"You can't go from MLK JR, President Obama, Oprah, Beyonce, to a sleezebag name Lenard.\" (Charlamagne's real name is Lenard McKelvey.)\n\nThe back and forth made for a clash of the titans on social media, with both men's posts drawing immediate reactions, reposts, and commentary across platforms.\n\nTrump didn't hold back, unloading on Charlamagne with a complete lack of decorum.\n\n\"The very wonderful and talented Lara Trump, whose show is a big ratings success, put racist sleazebag Charlamagne 'The God' on her show,\" Trump wrote. \"(Why is he allowed to use the word 'GOD' when describing himself? Can anyone imagine the uproar there would be if I used that nickname?)\"\n\nTrump was just getting started -- after that, he fired off a barrage of insults.\n\n\"He's a Low IQ individual, has no idea what words are coming out of his mouth, and knows nothing about me or what I have done.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Charlamagne suggested a deeper power struggle brewing inside the GOP -- one that might ultimately topple Trump.\n\n\"I think there's a political coup going on right now in the Republican Party that people aren't paying attention to,\" he told Lara Trump. \"I think this Epstein thing is going to be a way for traditional conservatives to take their party back, I really do.\"\n\n\"They know this is the issue that has gotten the base riled up. The MAGA base isn't letting this issue go, and for the first time, they know they can probably take their party back and not piss off the MAGA base.\"\n\nThough Lara Trump attempted to steer the interview back to her father-in-law's accomplishments, Charlamagne repeatedly challenged her claims.\n\n\"Anything that takes away Medicaid from people and puts them in a worse financial situation, I'm not for,\" he told the host.\n\nWhen she falsely claimed grocery prices were going down, Charlamagne simply said, \"No.\"\n\nClips of the exchange posted to Threads drew heavy engagement.\n\n\"There are 2 million people tuning into her show. He sat there and listened but did not allow her to lie,\" one user commented. \"People ARE NOT doing better. Groceries prices are NOT cheaper. America is WORSE than it was under Biden.\"\n\nAnother added, \"Grocery prices are higher than ever. I loathe these lying fascists.\"\n\nAfter his appearance, Charlamagne capitalized on Trump's fury by reposting his Truth Social rant, adding commentary of his own and a clip from \"The Daily Show\" featuring Jessica Williams' take on the situation. He doubled down on his earlier claims in the caption:\n\n\"Anyway Yes I Believe There Is A Political Coup happening in the Republican Party and I appreciate [Lara Trump] having me on #MyView last night to talk about that amongst many other things. Let's Discuss......\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, used the rest of his Truth Social post to tout his accomplishments, touching on everything from international diplomacy to his domestic policies.\n\n\"Like just ending 5 Wars, including a 31-year bloodbath between the Republic of the Congo and Rwanda... wiping out Iran's nuclear capabilities... creating the greatest economy, where prices and Inflation have come way down... Remember, one year ago our Country was DEAD, now it's the 'HOTTEST' Country anywhere in the World. MAGA!!!\"\n\nBut Trump may have met his match this time. Charlamagne took the feud a step further during an appearance on The Daily Show, where he pulled up a list of dementia symptoms from the Mayo Clinic -- then rolled footage of Trump over the past year showing signs of each one. By the end of the segment, after checking every box, Charlamagne concluded that Trump \"needs to be put into a retirement home, immediately.\"\n\nThis morning, Charlamagne brushed off Trump's personal insults during the Donkey of the Day segment, mocking the idea that being called a \"sleazebag\" or \"low IQ\" even fazed him.\n\n\"I've been surprising myself my whole life,\" he joked. Then he pivoted to a more serious message, accusing Trump of using authoritarian tactics to silence critics -- pointing to last week's firing of a federal labor statistics official who released unfavorable jobs data.\n\n\"Listen, my fellow Americans, we are in a strange time right now, a time we have never seen, because authoritarian strategy is being used against anyone who speaks out against this administration,\" Charlamagne declared. \"\n\nWe saw what happened Friday, President Trump orders, you know, the firing of the labor statistic chief after data shows unemployment rates are higher. I don't know if you know President Trump, but by firing this woman, you add it to the unemployment rate. But that, along with his reaction to what I said on Lara Trump, shows how authoritarians will attempt to bully people into pushing false narratives. President Trump, do you realize the best way to get the headlines you want is to simply do a good job? Is to simply do right by all Americans?\"\n\nCharlamagne also pushed back on Trump's accusation of racism, pointing out that the topic never even came up during his appearance with Lara Trump. But he explained, if he had wanted to talk about race, there was plenty he could've said.\n\n\"He called me a racist. I didn't mention race. Not one time on Lara Trump, I didn't bring up the fact that President Trump issued an executive order directing oversight of institutions like the Smithsonian to remove or suppress narratives about systemic racism in black history. They want to reframe cultural memory, to eliminate discussions of historical racial injustice that, along with the determination of diversity and civil rights programs, are considered very racist by a lot of civil rights advocates. I didn't even bring that up, okay?\"\n\nCharlamagne ended his remarks with a message directly to Trump -- part jab, part challenge. What followed was a pointed list of priorities, he said the former president should be paying attention to.\n\n\"President Trump, don't worry about Lenard, okay, don't worry about Charlemagne. To God, I know something I said, hit a nerve and rattled you a little bit, but I don't want you rattled. I want you to end wars, okay? I want you to keep the border secure. I want you to have the economy going. I want boom booming. Okay? I want all these things to be true. I am an American. I don't care who's in the White House. I want America to succeed. Okay, believe it or not, I'm rooting for you, but I need you focused. And right now you're not focused, okay, we need you focused on two things, the economy and Epstein. All right. I need you to keep the promises of a great economy and the promises of transparency with the Epstein files. And I don't want us as a people to be distracted whenever you see Trump trying to deflect from what's important keep him focused. Ask two simple questions, what about the economy? What about the Epstein files? Go on his mentions. Have pity parties all the time, and ask him those two things.\"",

        "title": "Former CDC director encourages vaccines as children head back to school",
        "body": "He said it's \"incredibly tragic\" when a child gets a disease that is preventable and called for parents to speak to their children's doctor about vaccines.\n\nDATA ABOUT UNVACCINATED SCHOOL CHILDREN. THEIR REPORT SHOWS NEARLY 4% OF AMERICAN KINDERGARTNERS HAD AN EXEMPTION FOR A REQUIRED VACCINE LAST YEAR. THAT LED TO ABOUT 138,000 NEW SCHOOL CHILDREN NOT RECEIVING OTHERWISE MANDATORY VACCINES. FOR MANY, THAT MEANT THEY DIDN'T GET THE DTAP VACCINE, WHICH PROTECTS FROM WHOOPING COUGH. AND NOW, AS CHILDREN HEAD BACK TO SCHOOL, WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT A RISE IN WHOOPING COUGH CASES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN 2024, MORE THAN SIX TIMES AS MANY WHOOPING COUGH CASES WERE REPORTED COMPARED TO THE YEAR BEFORE. THIS MORNING, WE WELCOME FORMER ACTING CDC DIRECTOR AND PRESIDENT OF THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION, DOCTOR RICH BESSER. DOCTOR BESSER, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE APPRECIATE IT. GREAT TO BE HERE, BRANDI. YOU KNOW, WE'VE HEARD THAT DATA ABOUT FEWER CHILDREN GETTING VACCINES. WHAT IMPACT DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAVE ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM? WELL, YOU KNOW, BRANDY, THERE'S SOMETHING INCREDIBLY TRAGIC WHEN A CHILD GETS A DISEASE THAT IS TOTALLY PREVENTABLE. AND THAT'S THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. THANKFULLY, MOST PARENTS MAKE THE DECISION TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN FULLY AND ON TIME. IN MY 30 YEARS OF PEDIATRIC PRACTICE, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ANSWERING PARENTS QUESTIONS SO THAT THEY FELT COMFORTABLE. BUT I WORRY THAT THIS SCHOOL SEASON WE'RE GOING TO SEE CLASSROOMS NOT WITH 4% OF KIDS NOT BEING VACCINATED, BUT WITH 2,550%, BECAUSE THAT NUMBER WHERE THEY SAY THAT 4% OF KIDS ARE PASSING UP VACCINES, DOESN'T CAPTURE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THE CLASSROOM, WHERE YOU TEND TO SEE GROUPING, WHERE PARENTS TALK TO EACH OTHER AND YOU HAVE SITUATIONS THAT ARE REALLY POWDER KEGS FOR FOR VIRUS TO ARRIVE AND CAUSE PROBLEMS. DOCTOR, I WANT TO BE CLEAR THOUGH, HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CHANGES TO VACCINE REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS SCHOOL YEAR? NO, NOT. NOT FROM LAST YEAR. YOU KNOW, THIS IS DONE BY STATES. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO CHECK CHECK AT YOUR STATES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, IN CALIFORNIA, TO GET OUT OF THE SCHOOL VACCINE REQUIREMENT, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION THAT MAKES IT DANGEROUS FOR FOR YOUR CHILD TO TO GET VACCINATED. IN SOME STATES, IT CAN BE PARENTAL CHOICE. MANY STATES, IT'S A RELIGIOUS PREFERENCE, BUT THERE ARE VERY FEW RELIGIOUS PROHIBITIONS TO TO VACCINATION. BUT I WORRY THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION BEING SPREAD BY BY POLITICAL LEADERS THAT PARENTS ARE GOING TO, YOU KNOW, WHO WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING, ARE GOING TO MAKE THE WRONG DECISION. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO TALK TO YOUR CHILD'S DOCTOR. AND THERE REALLY IS A PUSH BY PHYSICIANS LIKE YOURSELF, AS WELL AS THE THE ROBERT WOOD FOUNDATION, THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION, TO REALLY GET THE MESSAGE OUT. TELL US MORE ABOUT THE WORK THAT THE AGENCY IS DOING NOW, ESPECIALLY AS ALL THESE STUDENTS ARE HEADING BACK TO CLASS. YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT IS SO HARD FOR PARENTS TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO MAKE THEIR THEIR DECISIONS. THERE IS SO MUCH MISINFORMATION OUT THERE. AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO BE BE PART OF THE CHORUS THAT'S SAYING, YOU KNOW, DO THE RIGHT THING, GET YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED, MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION. THERE ARE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DISEASES THAT I SAW EARLY IN MY PEDIATRIC PRACTICE, TYPES OF MENINGITIS THAT WE JUST DON'T SEE ANYMORE. MEASLES WAS WAS DECLARED ELIMINATED FROM THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE. IT'S SPREADING. THE WHOOPING COUGH IS A DISEASE THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE SEEING IN OUR SCHOOLS LIKE WE CURRENTLY ARE, AND THAT'S ON THE RISE. THESE DISEASES ARE PREVENTABLE. AND WHEN YOU VACCINATE YOUR CHILD, YOU NOT ONLY PREVENT YOUR CHILD FROM GETTING GETTING SICK, YOU HELP PROTECT CHILDREN IN THE CLASSROOM WHO MAY HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM GETTING VACCINATED. IT'S A WONDERFUL THING YOU CAN DO. DOCTOR BESSER, WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US THIS MORNING. DEFINITELY A LOT FOR PARENTS TO KNOW AND TO CONSIDER AS THEY'RE PREPARING TO SEND THEIR LITTLE ONES BAC",

        "title": "Celtics minority owner offers record-breaking amount to buy, move WNBA team: reports",
        "body": "UNCASVILLE, Conn. (WTNH) - Longtime fans of the WNBA's Connecticut Sun say they feel a bit deflated after learning that the team is likely leaving the state at the end of the 2026 season.\n\nNews of the team's potential sale broke over the past few days, after a group led by Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca reached a deal to buy the Connecticut Sun for a record $325 million and move the team to Boston, The Associated Press learned. Pagliuca would also contribute $100 million for a new practice facility in Boston for the team, an anonymous source told the outlet.\n\nThe deal would mark the largest amount ever offered for a women's professional sports franchise, the New England Sports Network and The Boston Globe reported.\n\nPagliuca, on Sunday, released a statement through his group on social media, confirming an offer had been made to buy the team and move it out of Mohegan Sun Arena. But he said there were still approvals that had not been obtained from the WNBA's Board of Governors.\n\n\"Central to our proposal is enabling the Sun to play in larger capacity arenas in New England,\" Pagliuca wrote, in part. \"We believe our record-setting offer and deep commitment to growing the WNBA in the region that is home to the most passionate basketball fans in the nation will significantly benefit the league, the team, and all its fans.\"\n\nIf the deal goes through, the franchise wouldn't play in Boston until the 2027 season.\n\nThe Connecticut Sun, meanwhile, have played at the Mohegan Sun resort and casino in Uncasville for over 20 years, having been purchased by the Mohegan Tribe in 2003. (The team had been established as the Orlando Miracle several years before.)\n\nFans walking out of Sunday afternoon's loss to the New York Liberty say news of a probably sale is a tough pill to swallow.\n\n\"This is my 21st season, [I'm a] season ticket holder. It was just a real gut-punch,\" fan Debra Pudlo said. \"I wanted the league to stay around, and I thought that it was important that women had a league to play in here.\"\n\nAnd while the Sun wouldn't be going far, some call the move a dealbreaker when it comes to traveling out-of-state.\n\n\"As much as Boston keeps saying, 'Move the team to New England,' Connecticut is already part of New England. It is our team, it'll always be our team,\" fan Amanda Ballassi said.\n\nComing with her family, Ballassi says the team inspired her to play basketball herself as she grew up. While she feels bruised knowing she might not be able to continue that tradition with her daughter, she understands that the players might want to strive for some change.\n\n\"This is not a big market; it's really hard to get the high-caliber players here,\" Ballassi said. \"We've had a blast watching them and the ease of getting here, but totally makes sense.\"\n\nSome fans are still staying positive.\n\n\"They deserve more, there's no doubt about it. They deserve to have nicer facilities and they deserve respect,\" fan Margaret McGovern said. \"Wherever they play, get it in the basket!\"\n\nThe team had announced in May that it was searching for a potential buyer for the franchise and had hired investment bank Allen & Company to conduct the probe.\n\nThe WNBA has experienced rapid growth the last few seasons and ownership groups have been investing more into their teams, including player experiences. That has come in the way of practice facilities. The Sun are one of the few teams in the league that haven't announced any plans for a new training facility. (The Sun practices either at the arena in the casino or a local community center.)\n\nDespite the lack of facilities, the Sun have been one of the most successful teams in the league, making the postseason in 16 seasons, including a run of six straight semifinal appearances. But the team was hit hard this offseason with the entire starting five from last season leaving either via free agency or trade.\n\nConnecticut is currently in last place in the WNBA at 5-22. The team sent out a letter to season ticket holders last week saying they'd still be playing at the casino next year.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "body": "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Eight people including an Irish missionary and a 3-year-old child remained missing Monday after gunmen stormed an orphanage in Haiti, the latest attack in an area controlled by a powerful collection of armed gangs.\n\nAuthorities scrambled to relocate dozens of children and staff from the Saint-Hélène orphanage run by Nos Petits Frères et Sœurs, an international charity with offices in Mexico and France. The orphanage cares for more than 240 children, according to its website.\n\nAmong those kidnapped early Sunday was Gena Heraty, an Irish missionary who has worked in Haiti for 30 years and oversaw the orphanage. She was assaulted in 2013 when suspects broke into the orphanage and killed her colleague, according to Irish media.\n\nSunday marked the latest high-profile kidnapping involving a foreign missionary. In 2021, the 400 Mawozo gang kidnapped 17 missionaries, including five children, from a U.S. -based organization in Ganthier, east of the capital, Port-au-Prince. The majority were held captive for 61 days.\n\nSunday's kidnapping occurred in Kenscoff, a once peaceful community in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. The doors to the orphanage remained closed on Monday as Haiti's Institute of Social Welfare and Research worked with UNICEF to identify sites where children and employees could be relocated.\n\nNo one has claimed responsibility for the kidnappings in an area controlled by a gang federation known as \" Viv Ansanm.\" The U.S. this year designated it as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nSimon Harris, Ireland's deputy prime minister, said in a statement that the kidnappings of Heraty and the others were \"deeply worrying,\" and called for their immediate release.\n\nIn a past interview with the Irish Independent newspaper, Heraty recalled being threatened to death when suspects broke into the orphanage in 2013.\n\n\"They were quite aggressive. One had a hammer, one had a gun,\" she said. Heraty said her colleague was killed with a hammer after he rushed to help her and others.\n\n\"The last place you would expect a violent death to happen in Haiti would be in a house with special-needs people,\" she said. \"Life is just not fair. We know that. We just have to accept it.\"\n\nAt least 175 people in Haiti were reported kidnapped from April to the end of June of this year, with 37% of those cases occurring in Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe United Nations said a majority of those kidnappings were blamed on the Grand Ravine and Village de Dieu gangs, which form part of the Viv Ansanm federation.",

It's something that appeals to all ages.\"\n\nLightning and other new adult rides\n\nA thrill ride with rotating arms like a windmill is classified as a super spectacular thrill that goes 131 feet into the air.

        "body": "LIMA, Ohio (WKRC) - An Ohio woman took legal ownership of a dealership's name after her newly purchased car was repossessed.\n\nAccording to Fortune, citing court documents, Tiah McCreary took legal ownership of a KIA dealership's name after the business repossessed the vehicle around a month after she bought it, in what was described as an act of revenge.\n\nThe outlet reported that McCreary had been exploring legal options against the dealership when she learned that the business had failed to renew the registration on its name with the Ohio Secretary of State.\n\nMcCreary took action and registered it in her name, then filed a cease-and-desist order against the business, demanding that they stop using the name it has operated under since 2012, resulting in a legal battle between the two parties.\n\n* The background\n\nCiting the court documents, Fortune reported that McCreary went to Taylor Kia of Lima and, after deciding on a used Kia K5, received preliminary approval for a loan.\n\nThe lender determined at a later time, however, that McCreary's income was insufficient to receive final approval and the vehicle was repossessed while she was working, per the outlet.\n\nAccording to Fortune, McCreary demanded in court that the dealer stop using the name, but the business argued that an arbitration clause in the agreement she had signed to purchase the car made the court case invalid, to which the judge agreed.\n\nThe Third District appeals court reversed that decision, however, after ruling that while McCreary had signed the arbitration agreement, the claim over the use of the name \"Taylor Kia of Lima\" was not subject to arbitration because it was not connected to the purchase of the K5, the outlet reported.\n\n\"This claim is a separate matter that could be pursued independently of the other claims in the complaint that address the consumer transaction at issue. Since this claim does not fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement, this claim should not have been dismissed and sent to arbitration,\" the appeals court wrote, according to Fortune.\n\nAdditional legal proceedings will take place in the lower courts, per the outlet's report.",

        "title": "Cooler mornings, evenings giving a taste of fall. Can I burn leaves in my Delaware yard?",
        "body": "Cooler evenings and mornings are here, giving Delawareans a taste of fall.\n\nBut with fall comes leaves - and if you have trees on your property, that might mean lots and lots of leaves.\n\nWhile raking isn't super enjoyable, the process of bending to transfer leaves from a pile to a yard waste receptacle can be even more of a nuisance. By the end of fall, torching a pile of leaves looks a lot more appealing.\n\nBut what does Delaware law say about open burning, and are you allowed to burn leaves?\n\nIs it legal to burn leaves in Delaware?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nPer the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, leaves, grass clippings and \"garbage/trash\" are always prohibited.\n\nWhat is legal to burn in Delaware?\n\nDespite the above prohibitions, some open burning is allowed in the First State. There are conditions, however.\n\nResidents who live in a private home where \"no commercial or industrial activity is conducted\" can burn certain items. They include:\n\n* Cut or fallen branches or limbs\n\n* Shrubbery\n\nHow much can I burn at one time?\n\nResidents can only burn up to 27 cubic feet at a time. They also must build the fire \"as far as practicable from any adjacent property.\"\n\nDo I need to notify anyone before I start a fire in my yard?\n\nIt depends.\n\nIf you're building a fire to cook, a campfire, setting up a patio fire pit or holding a ceremonial fire, you don't have to give prior notice.\n\nHowever, burning of nonprohibited yard materials requires notification to the state fire marshal's office.\n\nThey can be reached at:\n\n* New Castle County: 302-323-5365\n\n* Kent County: 302-739-5665\n\n* Sussex County: 302-856-5600\n\nWhen can I open burn in Delaware?\n\nOnly recreational open burning - or the burning that doesn't require prior notification, such as campfires - is allowed all year round.\n\nAll other residential open burning must wait until Oct. 1. The last allowed day is April 30.\n\nThere are exceptions, however.\n\nAll open burning is prohibited on Air Quality Action Days, which is when Delaware's air quality has been forecast as unhealthy by the Regional Air Quality Partnership, DNREC says. This includes any burning activity that may have been previously approved. Days with unhealthy air quality are designated Code Orange or Code Red days based on the severity of the warning.\n\nThe state fire marshal may also issue a ban against open burning activity in individual counties or statewide.\n\nFinally, the National Weather Service may also issue a red flag warning against open burning activity due to \"unfavorable\" weather conditions that can cause dangerous fire conditions.\n\nWhat's the actual punishment in Delaware for illegal open burning?\n\nAccording to DNREC, penalties for illegal open burning range from $100-$500, \"plus a possible criminal record with conviction.\"\n\nTo report illegal burning, citizens can call the 24-hour Environmental Complaint Hotline at 1-800-662-8802. Verizon cell phone customers can also call toll-free #DNR.",
